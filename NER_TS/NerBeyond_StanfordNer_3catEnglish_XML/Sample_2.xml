My sister, Mrs. <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> <PERSON>Gargery</PERSON>, was more than twenty years older than I, and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she had brought me up "by hand." Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me, I supposed that <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> <PERSON>Gargery</PERSON> and I were both brought up by hand.

She was not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had a general impression that she must have made <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> <PERSON>Gargery</PERSON> marry her by hand. <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> was a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth face, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to have somehow got mixed with their own whites. He was a mild, good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,--a sort of Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.

My sister, Mrs. <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap. She was tall and bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her figure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in front, that was stuck full of pins and needles. She made it a powerful merit in herself, and a strong reproach against <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>, that she wore this apron so much. Though I really see no reason why she should have worn it at all; or why, if she did wear it at all, she should not have taken it off, every day of her life.

<PERSON>Joe</PERSON>'s forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many of the dwellings in our country were,--most of them, at that time. When I ran home from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> was sitting alone in the kitchen. <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> and I being fellow-sufferers, and having confidences as such, <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> imparted a confidence to me, the moment I raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it, sitting in the chimney corner.

"Mrs. <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> has been out a dozen times, looking for you, <PERSON>Pip</PERSON>. And she's out now, making it a baker's dozen."

"Is she?"

"Yes, <PERSON>Pip</PERSON>," said <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>; "and what's worse, she's got Tickler with her."

At this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round, and looked in great depression at the fire. Tickler was a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame.

"She sot down," said <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>, "and she got up, and she made a grab at Tickler, and she Ram-paged out. That's what she did," said <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>, slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at it; "she Ram-paged out, Pip."

"Has she been gone long, <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>?" I always treated him as a larger species of child, and as no more than my equal.

"Well," said <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>, glancing up at the Dutch clock, "she's been on the Ram-page, this last spell, about five minutes, <LOCATION>Pip</LOCATION>. She's a-coming! Get behind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you."

I took the advice. My sister, Mrs. <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>, throwing the door wide open, and finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause, and applied Tickler to its further investigation. She concluded by throwing me--I often served as a connubial missile--at <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>, who, glad to get hold of me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his great leg.

"Where have you been, you young monkey?" said Mrs. <PERSON>Joe</PERSON>, stamping her foot. "Tell me directly what you've been doing to wear me away with fret and fright and worrit, or I'd have you out of that corner if you was fifty Pips, and he was five hundred Gargerys."

"I have only been to the churchyard," said I, from my stool, crying and rubbing myself.

"Churchyard!" repeated my sister. "If it warn't for me you'd have been to the churchyard long ago, and stayed there. Who brought you up by hand?"

"You did," said I.

"And why did I do it, I should like to know?" exclaimed my sister.

I whimpered, "I don't know."

"I don't!" said my sister. "I'd never do it again! I know that. I may truly say I've never had this apron of mine off since born you were. It's bad enough to be a blacksmith's wife (and him a Gargery) without being your mother."
