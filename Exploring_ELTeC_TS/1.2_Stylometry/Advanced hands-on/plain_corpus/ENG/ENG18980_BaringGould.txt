DOMITIA.
 Flashes as of lightning shot from each side of a galley as she was being rowed into port.
      She was a bireme, that is to say, had two tiers of oars; and as simultaneously the double sets
      were lifted, held for a moment suspended, wet with brine, feathered, and again dipped, every
      single blade gleamed, reflecting the declining western sun, and together formed a flash from
      each side of the vessel of a sheaf of rays. 
 The bireme was approaching the entrance to the harbor of Cenchræa. 
 The one white sail was filled with what little wind breathed, and it shone against a
      sapphire sea like a moon. 
 Now, at a signal the oars ceased to plunge. The sail was furled, and the galley was carried
      into the harbor between the temple that stood on the northern horn of the mole, and the great
      brazen statue of Posei
      don that occupied a rock in the midst of the entrance, driven forward by the
      impulse already given her by the muscles of the rowers and the east wind in the sail. 
 This Cenchræan harbor into which she swept was one of the busiest in the world. Through it
      as through a tidal sluice rushed the current of trade from the East to the West, and from the
      Occident to the Orient. It was planted on a bay of the Saronic Gulf, and on the Isthmus of
      Corinth, at the foot of that lovely range of mountains thrown up by the hand of God to wall
      off the Peloponnesus as the shrine of intellectual culture and the sanctuary of Liberty. 
 And a furrow—like an artificial dyke—ran between this range and Hellas proper, a furrow
      nearly wholly invaded by the sea, but still leaving a strip of land, the Corinthian isthmus,
      to form a barrier between the Eastern and the Western worlds. 
 On the platform at the head of a flight of marble steps before a temple of Poseidon, in her
      open litter, lounged a lady, with the bloom of youth gone from her face, but artificially
      restored. 
 She was handsome, with finely moulded features and a delicate white hand, the fingers
      studded with rings, and a beautiful arm which was exposed whenever any one drew near whose
      admiration was worth the acquisition. Its charm was enhanced by armlets of gold adorned with
      cameos. 
 Her arched brows, dark in color, possibly owed their perfection of turn and their depth of
      color to dye and the skill of the artist who decorated her every day, but not so the
      violet-blue of her large eyes, although these also were enhanced in effect by the tinting of
      the lashes, and a touch of paint applied to their roots. 
 The lady, whose name was Longa Duilia, was attended by female slaves, who stood behind the
      litter, and by a freedman, Plancus, who was at her side with a set smile on his waxen face,
      and who bowed towards the lady every moment to hear her remarks, uttered in a languid tone,
      and without her troubling to turn her head to address him. 
 “He will soon be here,” said the lady; “the bireme is in the port. I can see
      the ruffle before her bows as she cuts the water.” 
 “Like the wave in my lady’s hair,” sighed Plancus. 
 “Abominable!” exclaimed Duilia, “when the ripple in my hair is natural and abiding, and
      that in the water is made and disappears.” 
 “Because, Mistress, the wavelets look up, see, and fall back in despair.” 
 “That is better,” said the lady. 
 “And the swelling sail, like your divine bosom, has fallen, as when——” 
 “Ugh! I should hope the texture of my skin was not like coarse sail-cloth; get behind me,
      Plancus. Here, Lucilla, how am I looking? I would have my lord see me to the best advantage.” 
 “Madam,” said the female slave, advancing, “the envious sun is about to hide his head in
      the west. He cannot endure, after having feasted on your beauty, to surrender it to a mortal.” 
 “Is not one eyebrow a trifle higher than the other?” asked Duilia, looking at herself in a
      hand mirror of polished metal. 
 “It is indeed so, lady, but has not the Paphian Goddess in the statue of Phidias the same
      characteristic? Defect it is not, but a token of divinity.” 
 “Ah,” said Duilia, “it is hereditary. The Julian race descends from Venus Genetrix, and I
      have the blood of the immortal ancestress in me.” 
 “Much diluted,” muttered Plancus into the breast of his tunic; he was out of humor at the
      failure of his little simile of the sail. 
 “By the way,” said the lady; “the stay in this place Cenchræa is positively intolerable. No
      society, only a set of merchants—rich and all that sort of thing—but nobodies. The villa we
      occupy is undignified and uncomfortable. The noise of the port, the caterwauling of sailors,
      and the smell of pitch are most distasteful to me. My lord will hardly tarry here?” 
 “My lord,” said the freedman, pushing forward, “he who subdued the Parthians, and chained
      the Armenians, to whom all Syria bowed, arrives to cast himself at your ladyship’s feet, and
      be led by you as a captive in your triumphal entry into the capital of the world.” 
 “You think so, Plancus.” She shook her head, “He is an obstinate man—pig-headed—I—I mean
      resolute in his own line.” 
 “Madam, I know you to be irresistible.” 
 “Well, I desire to leave this odious place. I have yawned here through three entire
      months.” 
 “And during these months, the temple of Aphrodite has been deserted, and the approaches
      grass-grown.” 
 “How would my Lady like to remove to Corinth?” said Lucilla. “The vessel will be taken to
      Diolcus, and there placed on rollers, to be drawn across the isthmus.” 
 “Oh! Corinth will be noisier than this place, and more vulgar, because more pretentious.
      Only money-lending Jews there. Besides, I have taken an aversion
      to the place since the death of my physician. As the Gods love me, I not see the
      good of a medical attendant who is so ignorant as to allow himself to die, and that at such an
      inconvenient moment as the present. By the Great Goddess! what impostors there be. To think
      that for years I committed the care of my precious health to his bungling hands! Plancus, have
      you secured another? I suffer frightfully at sea.” 
 “A sure token of your divine origin,” said the steward. “The Foam-born (Venus)
      rose out of and left the waves because the motion of them disagreed with her.” 
 “There is a good deal in that,” observed Longa Duilia. “Plancus, have you secured another?
      I positively cannot across Adria without one to hold my head and supply anti—anti—what do you
      call them?” 
 “Madam,” said the freedman, rubbing his hands together, “I have devoted my energies to your
      service. I have gone about with a lantern seeking an honest physician. I may not have been as
      successful as I desired, but I have done my utmost.” 
 “I prithee—have done with this rodomontade and to the point. Have you secured one? As the
      Gods love me! it is not only one’s insides that get upset at sea, but one’s outside also
      becomes so tousled and tumbled—that the repairs—but never mind about them. Have you engaged a
      man?” 
 “Yes, my Lady, I have lighted on one Luke, a physician of Troas; he is desirous of
      proceeding to Rome, and is willing to undertake the charge of your health, in return for being
      conveyed to the capital of the world at your charges.” 
 “I make you responsible for his suitability,” said Longa Duilia. 
 “Body of Bacchus!” she exclaimed suddenly, after a pause, “Where is the child?” 
 “Where is the lady Domitia Longina?” asked Plancus, as he looked about him. 
 “The lady Domitia, where is she?” asked Lucilla. 
 “The lady Domitia?”—passed from one to another. 
 “Where is she? What has become of her? As the Gods love me—you are a pack of fools. The
      more of you there are, so much the more of folly. You have let her gallop off among the odious
      sailors, and she will come back rank with pitch. Lucilla, Favonia, Syra, where is she?” 
 Duilia sat upright on her seat, and her eyes roamed searchingly in every direction. 
 “I never met with such a child anywhere, it is the Corbulo blood in her, not mine. The Gods
      forbid! O Morals!” 
 “Madam,” said a slave-girl coming up. “I saw her with Eboracus.” 
 “Well, and where is Eboracus. They are always together. He spoils the child, and she pays
      him too much consideration. Where are they?” 
 The slaves, male and female, looked perplexedly in every direction. 
 “Perhaps,” said Plancus, “she has gone to the altar of Poseidon to offer there thanks for
      the return of her father.” 
 “Poseidon, nonsense! That is not her way. She has been in a fever ever since the vessel has
      been sighted, her cheeks flaming and in a fidget as if covered with flying ants. Find the
      girl. If any harm shall have come to her through your neglect, I will have you all flayed—and
      hang the cost!” 
 She plucked a bodkin from her dress, and ran it into the shoulder of the slave-woman,
      Favonia, who stood near her, and made her cry out with pain. 
 “You are a parcel of idle, empty-headed fools,” exclaimed the alarmed and irritated mother,
      “I will have the child found, and that instantly. You girls, you have been gaping, watching
      the sailors, and have not had an eye on your young mistress, and no concern for my feelings.
      There is no more putting anything into your heads than of filling the sieves of the Danaides.” 
 “Madam,” said Plancus, for once without a smile on his unctuous face, “you may rest
      satisfied that no harm has befallen the young lady. So long as Eboracus is with her, she is
      safe. That Briton worships her. He would suffer himself to be torn limb from limb rather than
      allow the least ill to come to her.” 
 “Well, well,” said the lady impatiently, “we expect all that sort of thing of our slaves.” 
 “Madam, but do we always get it?” 
 “We! The Gods save me! How you talk. We! We, indeed. Pray what are you to expect
      anything?” 
 “The other day, lady,” hastily continued the steward eager to allay the ebullition he had
      provoked. “The other day, Eboracus nigh on killed a man who looked with an insolent leer at
      his young mistress. He is like a faithful Molossus.” 
 “I do not ask what he is like,” retorted the still ruffled lady, “I ask where she is.” 
 Then one of the porters of the palanquin came forward respectfully and said to the
      steward:—“If it may please you, sir, will you graciously report to my Lady that I observed the
      young mistress draw Eboracus aside, and whisper to him, as though urging somewhat,
      and he seemed to demur, but he finally appeared to yield to her persuasions, and
      they strolled together along the mole.” 
 Longa Duilia overheard this. It was not the etiquette for an underling to address his
      master or mistress directly unless spoken to. 
 She said sharply:—“Why did not the fellow mention this before? Give him thirty lashes.
      Where did they go, did he say?” 
 “Along the mole.” 
 “Which mole?” 
 “Madam, Carpentarius is afraid of extending his communication lest he increase the number
      of his lashes.” 
 “Well, well!” exclaimed the mistress, “We may remit the lashes—let him answer.” 
 “Carpentarius,” said the steward, “Her ladyship, out of the superabundance of her
      compassion, will let you off the thirty lashes, if you say where be Eboracus and the young
      lady, your mistress Domitia Longina.” 
 “Sir,” answered the porter, “that I cannot answer positively; but—unless my eyes deceive
      me, I see a small boat on the water, within it a rower and a young girl.” 
 “By the Immortal Brothers! he is right,” exclaimed Plancus. “See, lady, yonder is a cockle
      boat, that has been unmoored from the mole, and there be in it a rower, burly, broadbacked,
      who is certainly the Briton, and in the bow is as it were a silver dove—and that can be none
      other than your daughter.” 
 “As the Gods love me,” gasped Duilia, throwing herself back in the litter; “what
      indelicacy! It is even so, the child is besotted. She dotes on her
      father, whom she has not seen since we left Antioch. And she has actually gone to
      meet him. O Venus Kalypyge! What are we coming to, when children act in this independent,
      indecent manner. O Times! O Morals!” 
 It was even so. 
 The young girl had coaxed the big Briton to take her in a boat to the galley, so as to meet
      and embrace her father, before he came on shore. 
 She was a peculiarly affectionate child, and jealous to boot. She knew that, so soon as he
      landed, his whole attention would be engrossed by her very exacting mother, who moreover would
      keep her in the background, and would chide should the father divert his notice from herself
      to his child. 
 She was therefore determined to be the first to salute him, and to receive his endearments,
      and to lavish on him her affection, unchecked by her mother. 
 As for the slave, he knew that he would get into trouble if he complied with the girl’s
      request, but he was unable to resist her blandishments. 
 And now Domitia reached the side of the galley, and a rope was cast to the boat, caught by
      Eboracus, who shipped his oars, and the little skiff was made fast to the side of the vessel. 
 The eyes of the father had already recognized his child. Domitia stood in the bows and
      extended her arms, poised on tiptoe, as if, like a bird about to leap into the air and fly to
      his embrace. 
 And now he caught her hand, looked into her dancing, twinkling eyes, as drops of the very
      Ægean itself, set in her sweet face, and in another moment she was clinging round his neck,
      and sobbing as though her heart would break, yet not with sorrow, but through excess of
      otherwise inexpressible joy. 
 For an hour she had him to herself—all to herself—the dear father whom she had not seen for
      half a year, to tell him how she loved him, to hear about himself, to pour into his ear her
      story of pleasures and pains, great pleasures and trifling pains. 
 And yet—no, not wholly uninterrupted was the meeting and sweet converse, for the father
      said: 
 “My darling, hast thou no word for Lucius?” 
 “Lamia! He is here?” 
 The father, Cnæus Domitius Corbulo, with a smile turned and beckoned. 
 Then a young man, with pleasant, frank face, came up. He had remained at a distance, when
      father and daughter met, but had been unable to withdraw his eyes from the happy group. 
 “Domitia, you have not forgotten your old playmate, have you?” 
 With a light blush like the tint on the petal of the rose of June, the girl extended her
      hand. 
 “Nay, nay!” said Corbulo. “A gentler, kinder greeting, after so long a separation.” 
 Then she held up her modest cheek, and the young man lightly touched it with his lips. 
 She drew herself away and said: 
 “You will not be angry if I give all my thoughts and words and looks to my father now. When
      we come on shore, he will be swallowed up by others.” 
 Lamia stepped back. 
 “Do not be offended,” she said with a smile, and the loveliest, most bewitching dimples
      came into her cheeks. “I have not indeed been without thought of you, Lucius, but have spun
      and spun and weaved too, enough to make you a tunic, all with my own hands, and a purple
       clavus—it nigh ruined me, the dyed Tyrian wool cost—I will not say; but I wove little crossed L’s into the texture.” 
 “What,” said Corbulo. “For Lucius and Longina?” 
 The girl became crimson. 
 Lamia came to her succor. “That could not be,” said he, “for Longina and Lucius are never
      across, but alack! Lucius is often so with Lamia, when he has done some stupid thing and he
      sees a frown on his all but father’s face, but hears no word of reproach.” 
 “My boy,” said Corbulo, “when a man knows his own faults, then a reprimand is unnecessary,
      and what is unnecessary is wrong.” 
 Lamia bowed and retired. 
 And now again father and daughter were alone together in the prow observing the arc of the
      harbor in which the ship was gliding smoothly. 
 And now the sailors had out their poles and hooks, and they ran the vessel beside the
      wharf, and cast out ropes that were made fast to bronze rings in the marble breasting of the
      quay. 
 Domitia would at once have drawn her father on shore, but he restrained her. 
 “Not yet, my daughter,” he said; “the goddess must precede thee.” 
 And now ensued a singular formality. 
 From the bows of the vessel, the captain and steerer took a statuette of Artemis, in
      bronze, the Ephesian goddess, with female head and numerous breasts, but with the lower limbs
      swaddled, and the swaddling bands decorated with representations of all kinds of beasts,
      birds, and fishes. 
 This image was now conveyed on shore, followed by the passengers and crew. 
 On the quay stood an altar, upon which charcoal ever burnt, under the charge of a priest
      who attended to it continuously, and whenever a ship entered the port or was about to leave,
      added fuel, and raked and blew up the fire. 
 Simultaneously from a small temple on the quay issued a priest with veiled head, and his
      attendants came to the altar, cast some grains of incense on the embers, and as the blue
      fragrant smoke arose and was dissipated by the sea breeze, he said:— 
 “The Goddess Aphrodite of Corinth salutes her divine sister, the Many-Breasted Artemis of
      Ephesus, and welcomes her. And she further prays that she may not smite the city or the port
      with fire, pestilence or earthquake.” 
 Then captain, steerman, pilot and the rest of the company advanced in procession to the
      temple, and on reaching it offered a handful of sweet gums on an altar there, before the image
      of the foam-born goddess of Beauty, and said:— 
 “We who come from the sea, having safely traversed the Ægean, escaped rocks and sand-banks,
      whirlpools and storms, under the protection of the great goddess of Ephesus, salute in her
      name the goddess of Beauty, and receive her welcome with thankfulness. And great
      Artemis beseeches her sister to suffer her and the vessel with passengers and
      goods and crew, that she conducts and protects, to pass across the isthmus, without let and
      molestation; and she for her part undertakes to pay the accustomed toll, and the due to the
      temple of Aphrodite, and that neither the passengers nor the crew shall in any way injure or
      disturb the inhabitants of Corinth or of the Isthmus.” 
 This ceremony concluded, all were at liberty to disperse; the sailors to attend to the
      vessel, the slaves of Corbulo to look to and land such of his luggage as he was likely to
      want, and Corbulo to go to his wife, who had placed herself in an attitude to receive him. 
 The captain, at the same time, entered the harbor-master’s office to arrange about the
      crossing of the isthmus, and to settle tolls. 
 For the vessel was not to make more stay than a few days at the port of Cenchræa. After
      Longa Duilia was ready, then she and her husband and family were to proceed to Lechæum, the
      port on the Corinthian Gulf, there to embark for Italy. The vessel would leave the harbor and
      go to Diolchus, that point of the Isthmus on the east where the neck of land was narrowest.
      There the ships would be hauled out of the water, placed on rollers, and by means of oxen,
      assisted by gangs of slaves, would convey the vessel over the land for six miles to the Gulf
      of Corinth, where again she would be floated. 
 Immediately behind the Roman general, Corbulo, the father of Domitia, walked two
      individuals, both wearing long beards, and draped to the feet. 
 One of these had a characteristically Oriental head.
      His eyes were set very close together, his nose was aquiline, his tint sallow, his
      eyebrows heavy and bushy, and his general expression one of cunning and subtlety. His
      movements were stately. 
 The other was not so tall. He was clumsy in movement, rugged in feature, with a broken
      nose, his features distinctly Occidental, as was his bullet head. His hair was sandy, and
      scant on his crown. He wore a smug, self-complacent expression on his pursed-up lips and had a
      certain “I am Sir Oracle, let no dog bark” look in his pale eyes. 
 These two men, walking side by side, eyed each other with ill-concealed dislike and
      disdain. 
 The former was a Chaldæan, who was usually called Elymas, but affected in Greek to be named
      Ascletarion. 
 The latter was an Italian philosopher who had received his training in Greece at a period
      when all systems of philosophy were broken up and jostled each other in their common ruin. 
 No sooner was the ceremony at an end, and Corbulo had hastened from the wharf to meet and
      embrace his wife, and Lamia had drawn off Domitia for a few words, than these two men left to
      themselves instinctively turned to launch their venom at each other. 
 The philosopher, with a toss of his beard, and a lifting of his light eyebrows, and the
      protrusion of his lower lip said: 
 “And pray, what has the profundity of Ascletarion alias Elymas beheld in the bottom of that
      well he terms his soul?” 
 “He has been able to see what is hidden from the
      shallowness of Claudius Senecio alias Spermologos over
      the surface of which shallowness his soul careers like a water spider.” 
 “And that is, O muddiness?” 
 “Ill-luck, O insipidity.” 
 “Why so?—not, the Gods forfend, that I lay any weight on anything you may say. But I like
      to hear your vaticinations that I may laugh over them.” 
 “Hear, then. Because a daughter of Earth dared to set foot on the vessel consecrated to and
      conducted by Artemis before that the tutelary goddess had been welcomed by and had saluted the
      tutelary deity of the land.” 
 “I despise your prophecies of evil, thou crow.” 
 “Not more than do I thy platitudes, O owl!” 
 “Hearken to the words of the poet,” said the philosopher, and he started quoting the Œdipus
      Tyrannus: “The Gods know the affairs of mortals. But among men, it is by no means certain that
      a soothsayer is of more account than myself!” And Senecio snapped his fingers in the face of
      the Magus. 
 “Conclude thy quotation,” retorted Elymas. ““A man’s wisdom may surpass Wisdom itself.
      Therefore never will I condemn the seer, lest his words prove true.” How like you that?” and
      he snapped his fingers under the nose of the philosopher. 
 Cnæus Domitius Corbulo was the greatest general of his time, and he had splendidly served
      the State. 
 His sister Cæsonia had been the wife of the mad prince Caligula. She was not beautiful, but
      her flexible mouth, her tender eyes, the dimples in her cheeks, her exquisite grace of manner
      and sweetness of expression had not only won the heart of the tyrant, but had enabled her to
      maintain it. 
 Once, in an outburst of surprise at himself for loving her, he threatened to put her to the
      torture to wring from Cæsonia the secret of her hold on his affections. Once, as he caressed
      her, he broke into hideous laughter, and when asked the reason, said, “I have but to speak the
      word, and this lovely throat would be cut.” 
 Yet this woman loved the maniac, and when he had been murdered in the subterranean gallery
      leading from the palace to the theatre, she crept to the spot, and was found kneeling by her
      dead husband with their babe in her arms, sobbing and wiping the blood from his face. The
      assassins did not spare her. They cut her down and dashed out the brains of the infant against
      the marble walls. 
 Corbulo was not only able, he was successful. Under
      Nero he was engaged in the East against the Parthians, the most redoubted enemies
      of the empire. He broke their power and sent their king, Tiridates, a suppliant to Rome. 
 His headquarters had been at Antioch, and there for a while his wife and daughter had
      resided with him. But after a while, they were sent part way homewards, as Corbulo himself
      expected his recall. 
 They had been separated from him for over six months, and had been awaiting his arrival in
      a villa at Cenchræa, that had been placed at their disposal by a Greek client. 
 It was customary for those who did not live in Rome but belonged to a province, to place
      themselves under the patronage of a Roman noble; whereupon ensued an exchange of “cards” as we
      should say, but actually of engraved plates or metal fishes on which the date of the agreement
      was entered as well as the names of the contracting parties. Then, when a provincial desired
      assistance at the capital, in obtaining redress for a grievance in a lawsuit, or in recovering
      a debt, his patron attended to his client’s interests, and should he visit Rome received him
      into his house as an honored guest. 
 On the other hand, if the patron were on a journey and came to the place where his client
      could serve him, the latter threw his house open to him, treated him with the most profound
      respect and accorded to him the largest hospitality. So now the villa of a client had been
      placed at the disposal of Corbulo and his family, and he occupied it with as little hesitation
      as though it were his own. 
 It was a matter of pride to a Roman noble to have
      a large number of silver engraved plates and fishes suspended in his atrium,
      announcing to all visitors what an extensive clientèle he had, and the
      provincial was not less proud to be able to flourish the name of his distinguished patron at
      the capital. 
 On the evening following the disembarkation, Corbulo and his wife were seated on a bench
      enjoying the pleasant air that fanned from the sea; and looking over the terraced garden at
      their daughter, who was gambolling with a long silky-haired kid from Cilicia, that her father
      had brought as a present to his child. 
 She was a lovely girl, aged sixteen, with a remarkably intelligent face, and large, clear,
      shrewd eyes. 
 Yet, though lovely, none could say that she was beautiful. Her charm was like that of her
      aunt, Cæsonia, in grace of form, in changefulness and sweetness of expression, and in the
      brimming intellect that flashed out of her violet eyes. And now as she played with the kid,
      her every movement formed an artist’s study, and the simple joy that shone out of her face,
      and the affection wherewith she glanced at intervals at her father, invested her with a
      spiritual charm, impossible to be achieved by sculptor with his chisel or by painter with his
      brush. 
 The eyes of Domitius Corbulo followed his child, wherever she went, whatever she did. He
      was a man of somewhat advanced age, shaven, with short shorn hair, marked features, the brow
      somewhat retreating, but with a firm mouth and strong jaw. Though not handsome, there was
      refinement in his countenance which gave it a character of nobleness, and the brilliant eye
      and decision in the countenance inspired universal
      respect. Every one could see that he was not merely a commander of men in war, but
      a man of culture in the forum and the academy. 
 “Wife,” said he, “I pray you desist. It was for this that I sent you back from Antioch. You
      ever twanged one string, and I felt that your words, if overheard, might endanger us all.” 
 “I speak but into thine ear.” 
 “A brimming vessel overflows on all sides,” said Corbulo. 
 “Ah well! some men make themselves by grasping at what the Gods offer them. Others lose
      themselves by disregarding the favors extended by the Immortals.” 
 “I deny that any such offer was made me,” said the general in a tone of annoyance. 
 “What!” exclaimed Longa Duilia, “art thou so blind as not to see what is obvious to every
      other eye, that the Roman people are impatient at having a buffoon, a mimic, a fiddler wearing
      the purple?” 
 “Nevertheless, he wears it, by favor of the gods.” 
 “For how long? Domitius, believe me. In the heart of every Roman citizen rage is simmering,
      and the wound of injured pride rankles. He has insulted the majesty of eternal Rome. After
      having acted the buffoon in Italy, running up and down it like a jester on a tight-rope
      mouthing at the people, and with his assassins scattered about below to cut them down if they
      do not applaud—then he comes here also into Greece, to act on stages, race chariots, before
      Greeks—Greeks of all people! To me this is nothing, for all princes are tyrants more or less,
      and so long as they do not prick me, I care not. But here it does come close.
      In every army, in the breast of every soldier, rebellion springs up. Every general
      is uneasy and looks at the face of every other and asks, Who will draw the sword and make an
      end of this? O Morals! it makes me mad to see you alone quiescent.” 
 “When the Gods will a change, then the change will be granted.” 
 “You speak like a philosopher and not a man of action. If you do not draw, others will
      forestall you, and then—instead of my being up at the top—I shall be down in Nowhere.” 
 “Never will I be a traitor to Rome, and go against my oath.” 
 “Pshaw! They all do it, so why not you?” 
 “Because my conscience will not suffer me.” 
 “Conscience! The haruspices have never found it yet. They can discover and read the liver
      and the kidneys, but no knife has yet laid bare a conscience as big as a bean. You were the
      darling of the soldiery in Germany. You are still the idol of those who have fought under you
      in Parthia and Armenia. I am sure I did my best to push your cause. I was gracious to the
      soldiery—sent tit-bits from the table to the guard. I tipped right and left, till I spent all
      my pocket-money, and smiled benignantly on all military men till I got a horrible crumple here
      in my cheek, do you see?” 
 “Yes, shocking,” said Corbulo, indifferently. 
 “How can you be so provoking!” exclaimed Duilia pettishly. “Of course there is no wrinkle,
      there might have been, I did so much smiling. Really, Corbulo, one has to do all the
      picking—as boys get winkles out of their shells with a pin—to extract a compliment from
      you. And out comes the pin with nothing at the end. Plancus would not have let
      that pass.” 
 “Do you say that Nero is here?” 
 “Yes, here, in Greece; here at our elbow, at Corinth. He has for once got a clever idea
      into his head and has begun to cut a canal through the isthmus. It has begun with a flourish
      of trumpets and a dinner and a dramatic exhibition—and then I warrant you it will end.” 
 “The Prince at Corinth!” 
 “Yes, at Corinth; and you are here with all the wide sea between you and your troops. And
      docile as a lamb you have come here, and left your vantage ground. What it all means, the Gods
      know. It is no doing of mine. I warned and exhorted at Antioch, but you might have been born
      deaf for all the attention you paid to my words.” 
 “Never would I raise my sacrilegious hand against Rome—my mother.” 
 “Nay—it is Rome that cries out to be rid of a man that makes her the scorn of the world.” 
 “She has not spoken. She has not released me of my oath.” 
 “Because her mouth is gagged. As the Gods love me, they say that the god Caius (Caligula)
      named his horse Consul. Rome may have a monkey as her prince and Augustus for aught I care,
      were it not that by such a chance the handle is offered for you to upset him and seat yourself
      and me at the head of the universe.” 
 “No more of this,” said the general. “A good soldier obeys his commander. And I have an
       imperator,” he touched his breast; “a good conscience,
      and I go nowhere, undertake nothing which is not ordered by my master there.” 
 “Then I wash my hands of the result.” 
 “Come hither!” Corbulo called, and signed to his daughter who, with a flush of pleasure,
      left her kid and ran to him. 
 He took both her hands by the wrists, and holding her before him, panting from play, and
      with light dancing in her blue eyes, he said, “Domitia, I have not said one grave word to thee
      since we have been together. Yet now will I do this. None can tell what may be the next turn
      up of the die. And this that I am about to say comes warm and salt from my heart, like the
      spring hard by, at the Bath of Helene.” 
 “And strong, father,” said the girl, with flashes in her speaking eyes. “So strong is the
      spring that at once it turns a mill, ere rushing down to find its rest in the sea.” 
 “Well, and so may what I say so turn and make thee active, dear child,—active for good,
      though homely the work may be as that of grinding flour. When you have done a good work, and
      not wasted the volume of life in froth and cascade, then find rest in the wide sea of——” 
 “Of what?” sneered Duilia, “say it out—of nobody knows what.” 
 “That which thou sayest, dearest father, will not sleep in my heart.” 
 “Domitia, when we sail at sea, we direct our course by the stars. Without the stars we
      should not know whither to steer. And the steering of the vessel by the stars, that is
      seamanship. So in life. There are principles of right and wrong set in the firmament——” 
 “Where?” asked Duilia. “As the Gods love me, I never saw them.” 
 “By them,” continued Corbulo, disregarding the interruption, “we must shape our course, and
      this true shaping of our course, and not drifting with tides, or blown hither and thither by
      winds—this is the seamanship of life.” 
 “By the Gods!” said Duilia. “You must first find your stars. I hold what you say to be rank
      nonsense. Where are your stars? Principles! You keep your constellations in the hold of your
      vessel. My good Corbulo, our own interest, that we can always see, and by that we ought ever
      to steer.” 
 “Father,” said the girl, “I see a centurion and a handful of soldiers coming this way—and,
      if I mistake not, Lamia is speeding ahead of them.” 
 “Well, go then, and play with the kid. Hear how the little creature bleats after thee.” 
 She obeyed, and the old soldier watched his darling, with his heart in his eyes. 
 Presently, when she was beyond hearing, he said:— 
 “Now about the future of Domitia. I wish her no better fortune than to become the wife of
      Lucius Ælius Lamia, whom I love as my son. He has been in and out among us at Antioch. He
      returns with me to Rome. In these evil times, for a girl there is one only chance—to be given
      a good husband. This I hold, that a woman is never bad unless man shows her the way. If, as
      you say, there be no stars in the sky—there is love in the heart. By Hercules! here comes
      Lamia, and something ails him.” 
 Lucius was seen approaching through the garden.
      His face was ashen-gray, and he was evidently a prey to the liveliest distress. 
 He hastened to Corbulo, but although his lips moved, he could not utter a word. 
 “You would speak with me,” said the old general rising, and looking steadily in the young
      man’s face. 
 Something he saw there made him divine his errand. 
 Then Corbulo turned, kissed his wife, and said— 
 “Farewell. I am rightly served.” 
 He took a step from her, looked towards Domitia, who was dancing to her kid, above whose
      reach she held a bunch of parsley. 
 He hesitated for a moment. His inclination drew him towards her; but a second thought
      served to make him abandon so doing, and instead, he bent back to his wife, and said to her,
      with suppressed emotion— 
 “Bid her from me—as my last command—Follow the Light where and when she sees it.” 
 A quarter of an hour had elapsed since Corbulo entered the peristyle of the villa, when the
      young man Lamia came out. 
 He was still pale as death, and his muscles twitched with strong emotion. 
 He glanced about him in quest of Longa Duilia, but that lady had retired precipitately to
      the gynaikonitis, or Lady’s hall, where she had summoned to her a bevy of
      female slaves and had accumulated about her an apothecary’s shop of restoratives. 
 Domitia was still in the garden, playing with the kid, and Lamia at once went to her, not
      speedily, but with repugnance. 
 She immediately desisted from her play, and smiled at his approach. They were old
      acquaintances, and had seen much of each other in Syria. 
 Corbulo had not been proconsul, but legate in the East, and had made Antioch his
      headquarters. He had been engaged against the Parthians and Armenians for eight years, but the
      war had been intermittent, and between the campaigns he had returned to Antioch, to the
      society of his wife and little daughter. 
 The former, a dashing, vain and ambitious woman, had made a salon there
      which was frequented by the
      best society of the province. Corbulo, a quiet, thoughtful and modest man, shrunk
      from the stir and emptiness of such life, and had found rest and enjoyment in the company of
      his daughter. 
 Lamia had served as his secretary and aide-de-camp. He was a youth of much promise, and of
      singular integrity of mind and purity of morals in a society that was self-seeking,
      voluptuous, and corrupt. 
 He belonged to the Ælian gens or clan, but he had been adopted by a
      Lamia, a member of a family in the same clan, that claimed descent from Lamius, a son of
      Poseidon, or Neptune, by one of those fictions so dear to the Roman noble houses, and which
      caused the fabrication of mythical origins, just as the ambition of certain honorable families
      in England led to the falsification of the Roll of Battle Abbey. 
 Pliny tells a horrible story of the first Lamia of importance, known to authentic history.
      He had been an adherent of Cæsar and a friend of Cicero. He was supposed to be dead in the
      year in which he had been elected prætor, and was placed on the funeral pyre, when
      consciousness returned, but too late for him to be saved. The flames rose and enveloped him,
      and he died shrieking and struggling to escape from the bandages that bound him to the bier on
      which he lay. 
 Lucius Lamia had been kindly treated by Corbulo, and the young man’s heart had gone out to
      the venerated general, to whom he looked up as a model of all the old Roman virtues, as well
      as a man of commanding military genius. The simplicity of the old soldier’s manner and the
      freshness of his mind had acted as a healthful and bracing breeze upon the youth’s moral
      character. 
 And now he took the young girl by the hand, and walked with her up and down the pleached
      avenues for some moments without speaking. 
 His breast heaved. His head swam. His hand that held hers worked convulsively. 
 All at once Domitia stood still. 
 She had looked up wondering at his manner, into his eyes, and had seen that they were full. 
 “What ails you, Lucius?” 
 “Come, sit by me on the margin of the basin,” said he. “By the Gods! I conjure thee to
      summon all thy fortitude. I have news to communicate, and they of the saddest——” 
 “What! are we not to return to Rome? O Lamia, I was a child when I left it, but I love our
      house at Gabii, and the lake there, and the garden.” 
 “It is worse than that, Domitia.” He seated himself on the margin of a basin, and
      nervously, not knowing what he did, drew his finger in the water, describing letters, and
      chasing the darting fish. 
 “Domitia, you belong to an ancient race. You are a Roman, and have the blood of the Gods in
      your veins. So nerve thy heroic soul to hear the worst.” 
 And still he thrust after the frightened fish with his finger, and she looked down, and saw
      them dart like shadows in the pool, and her own frightened thoughts darted as nimbly and as
      blindly about in her head. 
 “Why, how now, Lamia? Thou art descended by adoption from the Earth-shakes, and tremblest
      as a girl! See—a tear fell into the basin. Oh, Lucius! My very kid rears in surprise.” 
 “Do not mock. Prepare for the worst. Think what would be the sorest ill that could befall
      thee.” 
 Domitia withdrew her eyes from the fish and the water surface rippled by his finger, and
      looked now with real terror in his face. 
 “My father?” 
 Then Lamia raised his dripping finger and pointed to the house. 
 She looked, and saw that the gardener had torn down boughs of cypress, and therewith was
      decorating the doorway. 
 At the same moment rose a long-drawn, desolate wail, rising, falling, ebbing, flowing—a sea
      of sound infinitely sad, heart-thrilling, blood-congealing. 
 For one awful moment, one of those moments that seems an eternity, Domitia remained
      motionless. 
 She could hear articulate words, voices now. 
 “Come back! O Cnæus! Come, thou mighty warrior! Come, thou pillar of thy race! Come back,
      thou shadow! Return, O fleeted soul! See, see! thy tabernacle is still warm. Return, O soul!
      return!” 
 She knew it—the conclamatio; that cry uttered about the dead in the
      hopes of bringing back the spirit that has fled. 
 Then, before Lamia could stop her, Domitia started from the margin of the pool, startling
      the fish again and sending them flying as rays from where she had been seated, and ran to the
      house. 
 The gardener, with the timidity of a slave, did not venture to forbid passage. 
 A soldier who was withdrawing extended his arm to bar the doorway. Quick as thought she
      dived below this barrier, and next moment with a cry that cut through the wail of the
      mourners, she cast herself on the body of her father, that lay extended on the
      mosaic floor, with a blood-stained sword at his side, and a dark rill running from
      his breast over the enamelled pavement. 
 Next moment Lamia entered. 
 Around the hall were mourners, slaves of the house, as also some of those of Longa Duilia,
      raising their arms and lowering them, uttering their cries of lamentation and invocations to
      the departed soul, some rending their garments, others making believe to tear their hair and
      scratch their faces. 
 In the midst lay the dead general, and his child clung to him, kissed him, chafed his
      hands, endeavored to stanch his wound, and addressed him with endearments. 
 But all was in vain. The spirit was beyond recall, and were it to return would again be
      expelled. Corbulo was dead. 
 The poor child clasped him, convulsed with tears; her copious chestnut hair had become
      unbound, and was strewed about her, and even dipped in her father’s blood. She was as though
      frantic with despair; her gestures, her cry very different from the formal expressions and
      utterances of the servile mourners. 
 But Lamia at length touched her, and said— 
 “Come away, Domitia. You cannot prevent Fate.” 
 Suddenly she reared herself on her knees, and put back the burnished rain of hair that
      shrouded her face, and said in harsh tones:— 
 “Who slew him?” 
 “He fell on his own sword.” 
 “Why! He was happy?” 
 Before an answer was given, she reeled and fell unconscious across her father’s body. 
 Then Lamia stooped, gathered her up tenderly, pitifully, in his arms, and bore her forth
      into the garden to the fountain, where he could bathe her face, and where the cool air might
      revive her. 
 Why was Corbulo dead? and why had he died by his own hand? 
 The Emperor Nero was, as Duilia had told her husband, at this very time in Greece, and
      further, hard by at Corinth, where he was engaged in superintending the cutting of a canal,
      that was to remove the difficulty of a passage from the Saronic to the Corinthian Gulf. 
 Nero had come to Greece attended by his Augustal band of five thousand youths with flowing
      locks, and gold bangles on their wrists, divided into three companies, whose duty it was to
      applaud the imperial mountebank, and rouse or lead enthusiasm, the Hummers by buzzing
      approval, the Clappers by beating their hands together, and the Clashers by kicking pots about
      so as to produce a contagious uproar. 
 Nero was possessed with the delusion that he had a fine voice, and that he was an
      incomparable actor. Yet his range was so small, that when striving to sink to a bass note, his
      voice became a gurgle, and when he attempted to soar to a high note, he raised himself on his
      toes, became purple in face, and emitted a screech like a peacock. 
 Not satisfied with the obsequious applause of the Roman and Neapolitan citizens who crowded
      the theatre to hear the imperial buffoon twitter, he resolved to contest for prizes in the
      games of Greece. 
 A fleet attended him, crowded with actors, singers,
      dancers, heaped up with theatrical properties, masks, costumes, wigs, and fiddles. 
 He would show the Greeks that he could drive a chariot, sing and strut the stage now in
      male and then in female costume, and adapt his voice to the sex he personated, now grumbling
      in masculine tones, then squeaking in falsetto, and incomparable in each. 
 But with the cunning of a madman, he took with him, as his court, the wealthiest nobles of
      Rome, whom he had marked out for death, either because he coveted their fortunes or suspected
      their loyalty. 
 Wherever he went, into whatsoever city he entered, his artistic eye noted the finest
      statues and paintings, and he carried them off, from temple as from marketplace, to decorate
      Rome or enrich his Golden House, the palace he had erected for himself. 
 Tortured by envy of every one who made himself conspicuous; hating, fearing such as were in
      all men’s mouths, through their achievements, or notable for virtue, his suspicion had for
      some time rested on Domitius Corbulo, who had won laurels first in Germany and afterwards in
      Syria. 
 He had summoned him to Rome, with the promise of preferments, his purpose being to withdraw
      him from the army that adored him, and to destroy him. 
 No sooner did the tidings reach the tyrant at Corinth, that the veteran hero was arrived at
      Cenchræa, than he sent him a message to commit suicide. A gracious condescension that, for the
      property of the man who was executed was forfeit and his wife and children reduced to beggary,
      whereas the will of the testator who destroyed himself was allowed to remain in force. 
 Lamia washed the stains from the hands and locks of the girl, and bathed her face with
      water till she came round. 
 Then, when he saw that she had recovered full consciousness, he asked to be allowed to
      hasten for assistance. She bowed her head, as she could not speak, and he entered the women’s
      portion of the villa to summon some of the female slaves. These were, however, in no condition
      to answer his call and be of use. Duilia had monopolized the attentions of almost all such as
      had not been commissioned to raise the funeral wail. Some, indeed, there were, scattered in
      all directions, running against each other, doing nothing save add to the general confusion,
      but precisely these were useless for Lamia’s purpose. 
 Unwilling to leave the child longer alone, Lucius returned to the garden, and saw Domitia
      seated on the breastwork of the fountain. 
 Ten years seemed to have passed over her head, so altered was she. 
 She was not now weeping. The rigidity of the fainting fit seemed not to have left her face,
      nor relaxed the stony appearance it had assumed. Her eyes were lustreless, and her lips
      without color. 
 The young man was startled at her look. 
 “Domitia!” said he. 
 She raised her eyes to him, and said in reply, 
 “Lucius!” Then letting them fall, she added in hard, colorless tones, “There is one thing I
      desire of thee. By some means or other, I care not what, bring me into the presence of the
      monster. I know how my father has come by his death—as have so many others, the best and the
      noblest. I have but one ambition on
      earth, I see but a single duty before me—to drive if it be but a silver bodkin
      into his heart.” 
 “Domitia!” 
 “Lucius, the last words my father used to me were to bid me look to the stars and to sail
      by them. I look and I see one only star. I feel but one only duty on earth—to revenge his
      death.” 
 “My friend!” said Lamia, in a low tone. “Be careful of thy words. If overheard, they might
      cause your blood to be mingled with his.” 
 “I care not.” 
 “But to me it matters sovereignly.” 
 “Why? Dost thou care for me?” 
 “Above all in the world.” 
 “Then revenge me.” 
 “Domitia, my grief is little less than thine. If you would revenge the loss, so would I.
      But what can be done? He, the coward, is carefully guarded. None are suffered to approach him
      who have not first been searched, and even then are not allowed within arm’s length. Nothing
      can be done, save invoke the Gods.” 
 “The Gods!” laughed the girl hoarsely. “The Gods! They set up the base, the foul, and crown
      him with roses, and trample the noble and good into the earth. The Gods! see you now! They set
      a star in heaven, they grave a duty in my heart, and the star is unattainable, and the duty,
      they make impossible of achievement. Bah! There is no star. There are no duties on earth, and
      no Gods in heaven.” 
 “It is of no use in the world, Plancus, your attempting to reason me out of a fixed
      resolve,” said the lady Longa Duilia, peevishly. “My Corbulo shall not have a shabby funeral.” 
 “Madam, I do not suggest that,” said the steward humbly, rubbing his hands. 
 “Yes, you do. It is of no good your standing on one leg like a stork. Shabby it must be—no
      ancestors present. As the Gods love me, you would not have me borrow ancestors of Asclepiades,
      our client, who has lent us this villa! He may have them or not, that is no concern of mine.
      Will you have done preening yourself like an old cockroach. I say it would be an indignity to
      have a funeral for my Corbulo without ancestors. O Times! O Morals! What is the good of having
      ancestors if you do not use them?” 
 “But, Madam, they are in your palace at Rome in the Carinæ—or at the Gabian villa.” 
 “And for that reason they are not here. Without the attendance of his forbears, my Corbulo
      shall not be buried. Besides, who is there to impress here with the solemnity? Only a lot of
      wretched sailors, ship sutlers, Jew pedlers and petty officials, not worth considering. I have
      said it.” 
 “But, Lady, Lucius Lamia agrees with me——” 
 “Lucius Ælius Lamia—it will not exhaust your lungs to give him his name more fully—is not
      as yet one of the family.” 
 “Madam, consider how Agrippina did with Germanicus—she had his pyre at Antioch, and
      conveyed his ashes to Rome.” 
 “Agrippina was able to have the funeral conducted with solemn pomp at Antioch. There were
      the soldiers, the lictors, great officers and all that sort of thing. Here—nothing at all. By
      the Immortals—consider the expenses, and none to look on gaping but tarry sailors and Jew
      rag-and-bone men.” 
 “Madam!” 
 “Silence. Without ancestors!—as impossible as without wood.” 
 To understand the point made so much of by the widow, the Roman funeral custom must be
      understood. 
 On the death of a noble or high official, his face was immediately moulded in wax, into a
      mask, or rather, into two masks, that were colored and supplied with glass eyes. One was
      placed over the dead face, when the corpse lay in state, and when he was conveyed to his
      funeral pyre, and the first effect of the rising flames was to dissolve the mask and disclose
      the dead features. 
 The ancient Greeks before they burned their dead laid gold-leaf masks on their faces, and
      in a still earlier time the face of the corpse was rouged with oxide of iron, to give it a
      false appearance of life. 
 But the second mask was preserved for the family portrait gallery. 
 When a Roman gentleman or lady was carried forth to his funeral pyre, he was preceded by a
      procession
      of actors dressed up in the togas and military or municipal insignia of departed
      ancestors, each wearing the wax mask of him he personified. For these masks were preserved
      with great care in the atrium of the house. 
 Now as Longa Duilia saw, to have her husband burned at Cenchræa, without a procession of
      imitation ancestors, would be to deprive the funeral of its most impressive feature. 
 Plancus had advised the burning at the port, with shorn rites, and that the ashes should be
      placed in the family mausoleum at Gabii, and that the utmost dignity should be accorded to
      this latter ceremony sufficient to content the most punctilious widow. 
 But this did not please the lady. The notion of a funeral with maimed pomp was distasteful
      to her; moreover, as she argued, it was illegal to have two funerals for the same man. 
 “That,” said Plancus, “hardly applies to one who has died out of Italy.” 
 “It is against the law,” replied Duilia. “I will give no occasion to objection, offer no
      handle to informers. Besides, I won’t have it. The respect I owe to Corbulo forbids the
      entertainment of such an idea. Really, and on my word, Plancus, I am not a child to be amused
      with shadow pictures, and unless you are making a rabbit, a fish, or a pig eating out of a
      trough, I cannot conceive what you are about with your hands, fumbling one over the other.” 
 “Madam, I had no thought——” 
 “I know you have none. Be pleased another time when addressing me to keep your hands quiet,
      it is irritating. One never knows where they are or will
      be, sometimes folding and unfolding them, then—they disappear up your sleeves and
      project none can guess where—like snails’ horns. Be pleased,—and now pawing your face like a
      cat washing itself. Please in future hold them in front of you like a dog when sitting up,
      begging. But as to the funeral—I will not have it cheap and nasty. Without ancestors a funeral
      is not worth having.” 
 “Then,” said the harassed freedman, “there is nothing for it but to engage an embalmer.” 
 “Of course—one can be obtained at Corinth. Everything can be had for money.” 
 As Plancus was retiring, the lady recalled him. 
 “Here,” said she, “do not act like a fool, and let the man charge a fancy price. Say that I
      have an idea of pickling Corbulo in brine, and have brought an amphora
      large enough for the purpose. Don’t close with his terms at once.” 
 When the steward was gone, then Longa Duilia turned her head languidly and summoned a
      slave-girl. 
 “Lucilla! The unfortunate feature of the situation is that I must not have my hair combed
      till we reach Gabii. It is customary, and for a bracelet of pearls I would not transgress
      custom. You can give my head a tousled look, without being dishevelled, I would wish to appear
      interesting, not untidy.” 
 “Lady! Nothing could make you other than fascinating. A widow in tears—some stray locks—it
      would melt marble.” 
 “And I think I shall outdo Agrippina,” said Duilia, “she carried her husband’s cinders in
      an urn at the head of her berth and on appropriate occasions howled in the most tragic and
      charming manner. But I shall
      convey the unconsumed body of my Corbulo in state exposed on his bier, in his
      military accoutrements all the way to Rhegium, then up the coast to Ostia and so to Gabii.
      There will be talk!” 
 “You will be cited in history as a widow the like of which the world has never seen. As for
      Agrippina, in your superior blaze she will be eclipsed forever.” 
 “I should prefer doing what Agrippina did—make a land journey from Brindisium, but—but—one
      must consider. It would be vastly expensive, and——” 
 But the lady did not finish the sentence. She considered that Nero might resent such a
      demonstration, as exciting indignation against himself, in having obliged Corbulo to put an
      end to his life. But she did not dare to breathe her thought even into the ear of a slave. 
 “No,” she said; “it would come too expensive. I will do what I can to honor my husband, but
      not ruin myself.” 
 When Longa Duilia had resolved to have her own way, and that was always, then all the
      entire family of slaves and retainers, freedmen and clients knew it must be done. 
 The vessel after a brief stay at Cenchræa had left for Diolcus where it had been placed on
      rollers and conveyed across the isthmus, and was launched in the Corinthian Gulf. 
 Nero had been engaged for some days in excavating a canal between the two seas. He had
      himself turned the first sod, but after getting some little way, rock was encountered of so
      hard a quality that to cut through it would cost time, toil and money. 
 He speedily tired of the scheme, wanted the money
      it would have cost for some dramatic exhibition, and was urged by Helios, a
      freedman whom he had left in Rome, to return to Italy, to prevent an insurrection that was
      simmering. Nero did not much believe in danger, but he had laden his fleet with the plunder of
      Greece, he had strutted and twittered on every stage, carried off every prize in every
      contest, and was desirous of being applauded in Italy and at Rome for what he had achieved,
      and exhibit there the chaplets he had won. 
 Accordingly he started, and hardly had he done so before the Artemis with spread sail swept
      down the Corinthian Gulf. 
 The ship, a Liburnian, of two banks of oars, was constructed very differently from a modern
      vessel. The prow was armed above water-mark with three strong and sharp blades, called the
       rostra, the beaks, which when driven into the side of an enemy would tear
      her open and sink her. 
 The quarter-deck was midships, and served a double purpose, being raised as high as the
      bulwarks it served as an elevated place where the captain could stand and survey the horizon
      and watch the course of the vessel, and it also served to strengthen the mast. 
 On this quarter-deck, on a bed of state, lay the body of Cnæus Domitius Corbulo, with his
      sword at his side, and the wax mask over his face. At his feet was a tripod with glowing coals
      on which occasionally incense and Cilician crocus were sprinkled, and on each side of his head
      blazed torches of pinewood dipped in pitch. 
 The poop had a covered place, called the aplaustre, in which sat the
      steerer. The hinged rudder had not then been invented, it was a discovery of the Middle
      Ages, and the head of the vessel was given its direction by the helmsman,
       gubernator, who worked a pair of broad flat paddles, one on each side. 
 The rowers, under the deck, were slaves, but the sailors were freemen. The rowers were kept
      in stroke by a piper, who played continually when the vessel was being propelled; and the
      rowers were under the direction and command of a hortator, so called
      because his voice was incessantly heard, urging, reprimanding, praising, threatening. 
 The captain of a Roman vessel was not supreme in authority on board ship as with us, but if
      the vessel contained military, he was subject to the control of the superior military officer. 
 The passage down the Corinthian Bay was effected without difficulty, before a favorable
      wind, but as the vessel was about to pass out of it, the wind suddenly changed and blew a
      squall from the west. And at this moment an accident occurred that was seriously embarrassing.
      Whilst the captain was standing near the steersman giving him directions relative to the
      passage of the straits, a wave rolling in caught the paddle, and caused it by the blow to snap
      the bronze bolt of the eye in which it worked, and the handle flying up and forward, struck
      the captain on the forehead, threw him down, and he fell against the bulwark so as to cut open
      his head. He had to be carried below insensible. 
 The Artemis lay under shelter till the gale abated, and then consultation arose as to what
      was to be done. 
 Lucius Lamia took the command, he was competent to manage the vessel, with the advice, if
      needed, of the mate. He and all were reluctant to put back to Lechæum, the port of Corinth, on
      the Gulf, and the broken
      eye in which the paddle worked was repaired with a stout thong, which, as the
      steersman said, would hold till Adria was crossed and Rhegium was reached. 
 The squall had passed, and the look of the sky was promising; moreover the wind was again
      favorable. 
 “Sir,” said the mate, “my opinion is that we should make all speed across Adria. This is a
      bad season of the year. It is a month in which sailing is overpassed. We must take advantage
      of our chances. While the wind blows, let us spread sail. The rowers can ship their oars;
      should the wind fail, or prove contrary, they will be required, and they may have a hard time
      of it. Therefore let them husband their strength.” 
 “So be it,” answered Lucius Lamia. 
 And now the Artemis, with sail spread, leaning on one side, drave through the rippling
      water, passed the Straits into the Adriatic, with the mountains of Ætolia to the north, and
      the island of Cephalonia in the blue west before her; and as she flew, she left behind her a
      trail of foam in the water, and a waft of smoke in the air from the torches that glowed about
      the dead general on the quarter-deck. 
 The day was in decline, and although the season was winter yet the air was not cold. The
      mountains of Greece lay in the wake like a bank of purple cloud tinged with gold. 
 On the quarter-deck reposed the corpse, with the feet turned in the direction of the prow;
      the torches spluttered, and cast off sparks that flew away with the smoke. 
 On each side were three slave women, detailed to wail, but Longa Duilia had issued
      instructions that they were not to be noisy in their demonstration so as to disturb or swamp
      conversation aft. 
 The undulating lament swerving through semi-tones and demi-semitones, formed a low and sad
      background to the play of voices on the lower deck, where, sheltered from the wind, the widow
      reclined on cushions, and her daughter Domitia sat at her side in conversation. 
 A change had come over the girl, so complete, so radical, that she seemed hardly to be the
      same person as before her father’s death. This was noticeable as being in appearance and
      manner,—noticeable even to the slaves, not the most observant in matters that did not
      particularly concern their comfort and interests.
      She had been transmuted from a playful child into a sad and serious woman. 
 The sparkle had left her eyes to make way for an eager, searching fire. The color had left
      her cheek; and her face had assumed a gloomy expression. The change, in fact, was much like
      that in a landscape when a sunny May day makes place for one that is overcast and threatening.
      The natural features are unaltered, but the aspect is wholly different in quality and
      character. 
 A mighty sorrow contracting, bruising, oppressing the heart sometimes melts it into a
      sweetness of patient endurance that inspires pity and love. But grief seemed to have frozen
      Domitia and not to have dissolved her into tears. 
 The philosopher approached with solemn stalk, walking on the flat of his soles. 
 Such men were retained in noble households as family chaplains, to advise, comfort, and
      exhort. And this man at intervals approached the widow, who on such occasions assumed a
      woe-begone expression, beat her brow and emitted at intervals long-drawn sighs. 
 At such times, the Magus, standing near, curled his lip contemptuously, and endeavored by
      shrugs and sniffs to let the bystanders perceive how little he valued the words of the stoic. 
 The philosopher Senecio now in formal style addressed the widow, and then turned to
      harangue the daughter, on the excellence of moderation in grief as in joy, on the beauty of
      self-control so as to suffer the storms of life to roll over the head with indifference. In
      this consisted the Highest Good, and to attain to such stolidity was the goal of all virtuous
      endeavor. 
 Then he thrust his hand into the folds of his toga, and withdrew, to be at once attacked
      and wrangled with by the Chaldæan. 
 Domitia, who had listened with indifference, turned to her mother as soon as he was gone,
      and said— 
 “The Summum Bonum, the crown and glory of Philosophy is to become in
      mind what the slave becomes after many bastinadoes, as callous in soul as he is on the soles
      of his feet. The lesson of life is not worth the acquisition.” 
 “I think he put it all very well.” 
 “Why are the strokes applied? Why should we bear them without crying out? After all, what
      profit is there in this philosophy?” 
 “Really, my dear, I cannot tell. But it is the correct thing to listen to and to talk
      philosophy, and good families keep their tame stoics,—even quite new and vulgar people,
      wretched knights who have become rich in trade—in a word, they all do it.” 
 “But, mother, what is this Highest Good?” 
 “You must inquire of Claudius Senecio himself. It is, I am sure something very suitable to
      talk about, on such solemn occasions as this.” 
 “But what is it? A runner in the course knows what is the prize for which he contends, a
      singer at the games sees the crown he hopes to earn—but this Highest Good, is it nothing but
      not to squeal when kicked?” 
 “I really do not know.” 
 “Mother, would to the Gods I did know! My sorrow is eating out my heart. I am miserable. I
      am in darkness, like Theseus in the labyrinth, but without a clue. And the Highest Good
      preached by philosophy
      is to sit down in the darkness and despair of the light. I want to know. Has my
      father’s life gone out forever, like an extinguished torch cast into the sea? or is it a
      smouldering ember that may be blown again into flame?” 
 “Have you not heard, Domitia, how Senecio has assured you that your father will live.” 
 “Where?” 
 “On the page of history.” 
 “First assure me that the page will be written, and that impartially. What I know of
      historians is that they scribble all the scurrility they can against the great and noble, in
      the hope of thereby advancing the credit of their own mean selves. Has a man no other hope of
      life than one built on the complaisance of the most malignant of men?” 
 “My dear,—positively, I do not know. You turn my head with your questions. Call Plancus
      that I may scold him, to ease my overwrought nerves. The fellow has been stopping up his
      wrinkles with a composition of wax, lard and flour, and really, at his age, and in his social
      position—it is absurd.” 
 “But, mother, I want to know.” 
 “Bless me, you make me squeamish. Of course we want to know a vast number of things; and
      the Highest Good, I take it, is to learn to be satisfied to know nothing. Cats, dogs, donkeys,
      don’t worry themselves to know—and are happy. They have, then, the Summum
       Bonum. If you want to know more, ask the philosopher. He is paid for the purpose,
      and eats at our expense, and ye gods! how he eats. I believe he finds the Highest Good in the
      platter.” 
 The lady made signs, and a slave, ever on the watch,
      hastened to learn her desire, and at her command summoned the Stoic. 
 The philosopher paced the deck with his chin in the air, and came aft. 
 “My daughter,” said the widow, “is splitting my suffering head with questions. Pray answer
      her satisfactorily. Here Felicula, Procula, Lucilla, help me to the cabin.” 
 When the lady had withdrawn, the philosopher said: 
 “Lady, you will propound difficulties, and I shall be pleased to solve them.” 
 “I ask plain answers to plain questions,” said Domitia. “At death—what then?” 
 “Death, young lady, is the full stop at the end of the sentence, it is the closing of the
      diptychs of life, on which its story is inscribed.” 
 “I asked not what death is—but to what it leads?” 
 “Leads!—it—leads! ahem! Death encountered with stoic equanimity is the highest point to
      which—” 
 “I do not ask how to meet death, but what it leads to. You seem unable or unwilling to
      answer a plain question. My dear father, does he live still—as a star that for a while sets
      below the horizon but returns again?” 
 “He lives, most assuredly. In all men’s mouths—on the snowy plains of Germany, on the arid
      wastes of Syria, the fame of Cnæus Domitius Corbulo——” 
 “I asked naught about his fame, but about himself. Does he still exist, can he still think
      of, care for, love me—as I still think of, care for, love him—” 
 Her voice quivered and broke. 
 “Young lady—Socrates could say no more of the future than that it is a brilliant hope which
      one may
      run the risk of entertaining. And our own Immortal Cicero declared that the hope
      of the soul living after death is a dream, and not a doctrine. The Immortals have seen fit to
      cut the thread of his life——” 
 “The Immortals had no scissors wherewith to do it. He fell on his own sword. Is there a
      soul? And after death where does it go? Is it a mere shadow?” 
 “My dear lady, philosophy teaches us to hope——” 
 “Natural instinct does that without the cumbrous assistance of philosophy—but what is that
      hope built on?” 
 “I cannot tell.” 
 “Then of what avail is it to lead a good life?” 
 “On the page of history——” 
 “That is where the great man lives—but the poor girl or the mechanic? Of what avail is a
      good life? What motive have we to induce us to lead it?” 
 “The approval of the conscience.” 
 “But why should it approve? What is good? Where is it written that this is good and that is
      evil?” 
 “I cannot tell.” 
 “So,” said the girl, and she signed to Elymas to approach. He came up with a sneer at the
      philosopher, who retired in discomfiture. 
 “You, Chaldæan, answer me that which confounds the Stoic. You have learning in the East
      which we have not in the West. Tell me—what is the human soul? and has it an existence after
      death?” 
 “Certainly, lady. The soul is a ray of Divine light, an æon out of infinite perfection.
      This ray is projected into space and enters into and is entangled in matter, and that is life,
      in the plant, in the fish, in the bird, in the beast, in man.” 
 “And what after death?” 
 “Death is the disengagement of this ray from its envelope. It returns to the source, to the
       pleroma or fulness of being and light whence it emanated, and loses itself
      in the one urn of splendor!” 
 “But when Pactolus and Styx run into the sea, the waters are mingled and lost, as to their
      individuality.” 
 “And so with the spirits of men.” 
 “What!” exclaimed Domitia. “When I die my little ray re-enters the sun and is lost in the
      general glory—and my father’s ray is also sucked in and disappears! There is no comfort in a
      thought where individuality is extinguished. But say. How know you that what you have
      propounded is the truth?” 
 The Magus hesitated and became confused. 
 “It is,” said he, “a solution at which the minds of the great thinkers of the East have
      arrived.” 
 “I see,” said Domitia, “it is no more than a guess. You and all alike are stagnant pools,
      whose muddy bottoms ferment and generate and throw up guesswork bubbles. One bubble looks more
      substantial than another, yet are all only the disguise of equal emptiness.” 
 The Chaldæan withdrew muttering in his beard. Domitia looked after him and noticed the
      physician Luke standing near, leaning over the bulwarks. 
 He was an elderly man, with kindly soft eyes, and a short beard in which some strands of
      gray appeared. A modest man, ready when called on to advise, but never self-assertive. 
 Domitia had noticed him already and had taken a liking to him, though she had not spoken to
      him. An unaccountable impulse induced her to address him. 
 “They are all quacks,” she said. 
 “They must needs be seekers, and the best they can produce, is out of themselves, and that
      conjecture. From the depths of the intellect what can be brought up than a more or less
      plausible guess?” 
 “And on these guesses we must live, like those who float across the Tigris and Euphrates—on
      rafts supported by inflated bladders. There is then no solid ground?” 
 “Man inflates the bladders—God lays the rocky basis.” 
 “What mean you?” 
 “No certainty can be attained, in all these things man desires to know, the basis of hope,
      the foundation of morality, that cannot be brought out of man. It can only be known by
      revelation of God.” 
 “And till he reveals we must drift on wind-bags. Good lack!” 
 “Do you think, Lady, that He who made man, and planted in man’s heart a desire for a future
      life, and made it necessary for his welfare that he should know to discern between good and
      evil, should leave him forever in the dark—like as you said Theseus in the labyrinth, without
      a clue?” 
 “But where is the clue?” 
 “Or think you that He who launched the vessel of man, having carefully laid the keel and
      framed the ribs, and set in her a pilot, should send her forth into unknown seas to certain
      wreckage—to be wafted up and down by every wind—to be carried along by every current—to fall
      on reefs, or be engulfed by quicksands, and not to reach a port, and He not to set lights
      whereby her course may be directed?” 
 “But where are the lights?” 
 At that moment, before Luke could answer, Lamia, who had been in the fore part of the
      vessel, came hastily aft, and disregarding the physician, heedless of the conversation on
      which he broke in, said hurriedly and in agitated tone:— 
 “The Imperial galley!” 
 The Imperial galley! 
 Domitia leaped to her feet. Everything was forgotten in the one thought that before her, on
      the sea, floated the man who had caused the death of her father. 
 “Lucius I must see——” 
 He drew her forward, but at the same time checked her speech. 
 “Every word dropped is fraught with danger,” he said. “What know you but that yon physician
      be a spy?” 
 “He is not that,” she answered, “show him to me—him——” 
 They walked together to the bows. 
 With the declining of the sun, the light wind had died away, and, although the sea heaved
      after the recent storm, like the bosom of a sleeping girl, in the stillness of the air, the
      sail drooped and the ship made no way. 
 Accordingly the sail was furled, and, by the advice of the mate, the rowers, who had rested
      during the day, were summoned to their benches and bidden work the oars during the night. 
 The sky was clear, and the stars were beginning to twinkle. No part of the voyage in calm
      weather would be less dangerous than this, which might be performed at night, across open sea,
      unbroken by rocks and sand-banks. 
 So long as the vessel had to thread her way between the headland of Araxus and the
      Echinades, and then betwixt the isles of Cephalonia and Zacynthus, an experienced navigator
      was necessary, and caution had to be exercised both in the management of the sail and in the
      manipulation of the helm. But now all was plain, and the mate had retired below to rest.
      During the time he reposed Lamia took charge of the vessel, assisted by the second mate. 
 “You take your meridian by Polaris, Castor and Pollux, steer due west; if there be a slight
      deviation from the right course, that is a trifle. I will set it right when my watch comes.” 
 Such was the mate’s injunction as he retired below. 
 “The steersman is done up,” said Lamia; “he shall rest now, and no better man can be found
      to replace him than Eboracus, who has been accustomed to the stormy seas of Britain, and whose
      nerves are of iron.” 
 Indeed, the gubernator or helmsman had hard work for his arms. The two
      enormous paddles had short cross-pieces let into them, like the handles of a scythe, and the
      clumsy and heavy mechanism for giving direction to the head of the vessel was worked by
      leverage in this manner. 
 The sailors managed everything on deck, the cordage, the anchors, the sail and the boats.
      In rough weather they undergirded the ship; that is to say,
      passed horizontal cords round her to brace the spars together so as to facilitate
      resistance to the strain when laboring against the waves. The sailors were under the direction
      of the captain or trierarch, so called whether he commanded a trireme or a Liburnian of two
      benches. 
 On deck the steersman occupied a sort of sentry-box in the stern, and beside him sat the
      mate, the second mate, and often also the captain, forming a sort of council for the direction
      of the vessel. 
 It was a favorite figure in the early Church to represent the Bishop as the helmsman of the
      sacred vessel, and the presbyters who sat about him as the mates occupying the stern bench. As
      already said, in a Roman vessel, there was a lack of that unity in direction under the captain
      to which we are accustomed. A military officer was always supreme everywhere on sea as on
      land. 
 When the sailors were engaged in sailing, then the rowers rested or caroused, and when they
      in turn bowed over the oars, the sailors had leisure. 
 The sun went down in the west, lighting up the sky above where he set with a rainbow or
      halo of copper light fading into green. 
 The night fell rapidly, and the stars looked out above and around, and formed broken
      reflections in the sea. 
 In winter the foam that broke and was swept to right and left had none of the flash and
      luminosity it displayed in summer, when the water was warm. 
 Already in the wake the Greek isles and mountain ridges had faded into night. 
 The oars dipped evenly, and the vessel sped for
      ward at a speed equal to that of a modern Channel steamer. 
 At a signal from Lamia the mourners on the quarter-deck ceased to intone their wail. 
 He and Domitia stood in the bows and looked directly before them. They could see a large
      vessel ahead, of three banks of oars, but she floated immovable on the gently heaving, glassy
      sea. The oars were all shipped and she was making no way. 
 The deck sparkled with lights. Torches threw up red flames, lamps gave out a fainter yellow
      gleam. To the cordage lights had been suspended, and braziers burning on the quarter-deck, fed
      with aromatic woods, turned the water around to molten fire, and sent wafts of fragrance over
      the sea. 
 The twang of a lyre and the chirp of a feeble voice were faintly audible; and then, after a
      lull, ensued a musical shout of applause in rhythmic note. 
 “It is the Augustus singing,” said Lamia in a tone of smothered rage and mortification.
      “And he has his band of adulators about him.” 
 “But why do not the rowers urge on the vessel?” asked Domitia. 
 “Because the piper giving the stroke would be committing high treason in drowning the song
      of the princely performer. By the Gods! the grinding of the oars in the rowlocks and the plash
      in the water would drown even his most supreme trills.” 
 “Hast thou seen him on the stage, Lamia?” 
 “The Gods forbid,” answered the young man passionately, “this fancy to be the first of
      singers and mimes had not come on him before I left Rome for Syria. To think of it, that
      he—the head of the magis
      tracy, of the army, of the senate, of the priesthood, should figure as Apollo,
      half naked, in a gold-powdered wig, and with painted cheeks before sniggering Greeks! The Gods
      deliver me from such a sight!” 
 “But you will behold it now. As we speed along we shall overtake this floating dramatic
      booth.” 
 “I will give her a wide berth, and stop my ears with wax, though, by the Gods! this is no
      siren song.” 
 Domitia leaned over the side of the vessel. 
 “Are they sharp, Lucius?” 
 “Are what sharp, Domitia?” 
 “The beaks.” 
 “Sharp as lancets.” 
 “And strong?” 
 “Strong as rams.” 
 “Then, Lucius, we will not give her wide berth. You loved my father. You regard me. You
      will do what I desire, for his sake and for mine.” 
 “What would you have of me?” 
 “Ram her!” 
 Lucius Lamia started, and looked at the girl. 
 She laid her hand on his arm, and gripped it as with an iron vice. 
 “Run her down, Lucius! Sink the accursed murderer and mountebank in the depths of the
      Ionian sea.” 
 Lamia gasped for breath. 
 She looked up into his face. 
 “Can it be done?” 
 “By Hercules! we could rip up her side.” 
 “Then do so.” 
 He stood undecided. 
 “Hearken to me. None will suspect our intention as we swiftly shoot up—no, none in this
      vessel, only
      Eboracus must be in it. Suddenly we will round and ram and welt her; and send the
      new Orion with his fiddle to the fishes. By the Furies! We shall hear him scream. We shall see
      him beat the waves. Lucius, let me have a marline-spike to dash at him as he swims and split
      his skull and let out his brains for the fishes to banquet on them.” 
 “We risk all our lives.” 
 “What care I? My father, your friend, will be avenged.” 
 Still Lamia stood in unresolve. 
 “Lucius! I will twine my white arms about your neck, and will kiss you with my red lips,
      the moment his last scream has rung in my ears.” 
 “In the name of Vengeance—then,” said Lamia. 
 “Eboracus I can count on,” said Domitia. 
 “There is the under-mate. If any one on board suspect our purpose, we are undone.” 
 “None need suspect,” said the girl. “Say that the prince is holding festival on board the
      trireme, and that it behoves us to salute. None will think other than that we are befooling
      ourselves like the rest. At the right moment, before any has a thought of thy purpose, call
      for the double-stroke, and trust Eboracus—he will put the helm about, and in a moment we run
      her down.” 
 Lamia walked to the quarter-deck, bade the mourning women go below. He extinguished the
      funeral torches, and threw the ashes from the tripod into the sea. Then the Artemis was no
      longer distinguishable by any light she bore. 
 Next Lamia walked aft, and in a restrained voice said: 
 “The vessel of Cæsar is before us. We dare not pass without leave asked and granted.” 
 “All right, sir,” said the second mate. “Any orders below?” 
 “Keep on at present speed. When I call Slack, then let them slacken. When I call Double,
      then at once with full force double.” 
 “Right, sir. I will carry down instructions.” 
 The mate went to the ladder and descended into the hold. 
 There were now left on deck only Lamia, Domitia, the steersman, Eboracus, one sailor and
      the physician, who was leaning over the bulwarks looking north at the glittering constellation
      of Cassiopea’s Chair. 
 He was near the quarter-deck, in the fore part of the vessel, and had been unobserved in
      the darkness by Lamia and Domitia, till they returned aft. 
 Then the young man started as he observed him. 
 Was it possible that the man had overheard the words spoken? There was nothing in the
      attitude or manner of the physician to show that he entertained alarm. Lamia resolved on
      keeping an eye upon him that he did not communicate with the crew. 
 Luke returned aft when the young people came in that direction, and seated himself quietly
      on a bench. 
 Eboracus was rapidly communicated with and gained. 
 The Artemis flew forward, noiselessly, save for the plunge of the oars and the hiss of the
      foam, as it rushed by like milk, and from the hold sounded the muffled note of the
       symphonicius or piper. 
 Every moment the vessel neared the imperial galley, and sounds of revelry became audible.
      Nothing
      showed that any on board were aware of the approach of a Liburnian. 
 It was now seen that tables were spread on the deck of the Imperial vessel, and that the
      prince and his attendants, and indeed the entire crew were engaged in revelry. 
 Between the courses which were served, Nero ascended the quarter-deck, and sang or else
      delivered a recitation from a Greek tragedian, or a piece of his own composition. 
 If the approach of the bireme was observed, which did not seem to be the case, it caused no
      uneasiness. The Emperor’s vessel had been accompanied by a convoy, but the ships had been
      dispersed by the storm; and the bireme, if perceived, was doubtless held to be one of the
      fleet. 
 And now Helios, the confidant of Nero, had ascended the quarter-deck to his master, and
      began to declaim the speech of the attendant in the Electra descriptive of the conquests of
      Orestes—applying the words, by significant indications to the prince returning a victor from
      the Grecian games. 
 “He, having come to the glorious pageantry of the sports in Greece, entered the lists to
      win the Delphic prizes, he, the admired of every eye. And having started from his goal in
      wondrous whirls he sped along the course, and bore away the of all coveted prize of victory.
      But that I may tell thee in few words amidst superfluity I have never known such a man of
      might and deeds as he—” and he bowed and waved his hands towards Nero. 
 A roar of applause broke out, interrupted by a cry from Nero who suddenly beheld a dark
      ship plunge
      out of the night and come within the radiance of the lights on board his vessel. 
 Meanwhile, on the Artemis, with set face sat Eboracus, guiding the head of the Liburnian as
      directed. He could see the twinkling lights, and hear the sounds of rejoicing. 
 “Slack speed,” called Lamia. 
 “Slack your oars,” down into the hold. 
 There was a pause—all oars held poised for a moment. 
 “Double!” shouted Lamia. 
 “Double your oars!” down the ladder. 
 Instantly the water hissed about the bows, and the oars plunged. 
 Eboracus by a violent movement threw himself and his entire weight on the handle of one
      paddle, so as to turn the bireme about, and ram her midships into the Imperial trireme, when
      suddenly, without a word, Luke had drawn a knife through the thong that restrained the paddle,
      and instantly the pedalion leaped out of place, and would have gone
      overboard, had not the physician caught and retained it. 
 Immediately the direction of the Artemis was altered and in place of running into the
      trireme, she swerved and swung past the Imperial galley without touching her. 
 Nero, white with alarm and rage shrieked from the quarter-deck, 
 “Who commands?” 
 Then to those by him, “Pour oil on the flames.” 
 At once from the braziers, tongues of brilliant light leaped high into the air. 
 “The name!” yelled the furious prince. 
 Then came the reply:— 
 “Cnæus Domitius Corbulo.” 
 And by the glare he saw, standing by the mast, distinct against the darkness of the night
      behind, the form of a man—and the face was the face of the murdered general. 
 Nero staggered back—and would have fallen unless caught by Helios. 
 “The dead pursue me,” he gasped. “Wife, mother, brother, and now, Corbulo!” 
 “It is well done,” said Eboracus in an undertone to the physician; “Otherwise there had
      been the cross for you and me. The thong broke.” 
 “I severed it,” said Luke. 
 “That I saw,” said the slave, “I shall report that it yielded. One must obey a master even
      to the risk of the cross. Did’st see the noble Lamia, how ready he was? He assumed the mask of
      my dead master and we have slipped by and sent a shiver through the whole company of the
      Trireme, and the August too, I trow,—for they have thought us the Ship of the Dead.” 
 After a pause he said,—“In my home we hold that all souls go to sea in a phantom vessel;
      and sail away to the West, to the Isles of the Blessed. At night a dark ship with a sail as a
      thundercloud comes to the shore, and those near can hear the dead in trains go over the beach
      and enter the ghostly vessel, till she is laden, and then she departs.” 
 The Artemis made her way without disaster to Rhegium, and thence coasted up Italy to the
      port of Rome. She had gained on the Imperial vessel, that was delayed at Brundusium to collect
      the scattered fleet. Nero would not land until he reached Neapolis, and then not till all his
      wreaths and golden apples, as
      well as his entire wardrobe of costumes and properties had arrived. 
 Then only did he come ashore, and he did so to commence a triumphal progress through the
      Peninsula, the like of which was never seen before nor will be seen again. 
 This was on the 19th March, the anniversary of the murder of his mother. On the same day a
      letter was put into his hands announcing the revolt of the legions in Gaul and the
      proclamation of Galba, at that time Governor of Spain. 
 So engrossed, however, was his mind with preparation for his theatrical procession, that he
      paid no heed to the news, nor was he roused till he read the address of Vindex, who led the
      revolt, denouncing him as a “miserable fiddler.” 
 This touched him to the quick, and he addressed an indignant despatch to the Senate,
      demanding that Vindex should be chastised, and appealed to the prizes he had gained as
      testimony to his musical abilities. 
 So he started for Rome. 
 Eighteen hundred and eight heralds strutted before him, bearing in their hands the crowns
      that had been awarded him and announcing when and how he had succeeded in winning the award. 
 He entered Rome in this leisurely manner, in a triumphal chariot, wearing a purple robe,
      embroidered with gold, an olive garland about his head. Beside him a harper struck his
      instrument and chanted his praises. 
 The houses were decorated with festoons, the streets were strewn with saffron; singing
      birds, comfits, flowers were scattered by the people before him. If the Sen
      ate expected that now the prince was in Rome, he would attend to business, it was
      vastly mistaken. His first concern was to arrange for a splendid exhibition in which he might
      gratify the public with a finished study of his acting and singing. 
 Solicitude about his triumph, his voice, his reception, had so completely filled the
      shallow mind of Nero, that he gave no further thought to the vessel that had shot out of the
      darkness, nearly fouled his galley, and which had been apparently commanded by one of his
      noblest victims. 
 Longa Duilia arrived on the Gabian estate, with the corpse of her husband, her daughter,
      Lucius Lamia, and her entire “family,” as the company of household slaves was termed, without
      accident and without deter. 
 Gabii lay eleven miles from Rome at the foot of one of the spurs of the Alban mountains.
      The town stood on a small knoll rising out of the Campagna. The stone of which it was built
      was dark, being a volcanic peperino; it was perhaps one of the least attractive sites for a
      country residence, which a Roman noble could have selected; but this was not without its
      advantage, when Emperors acted as did Ahab, and cut off those whose villas and vineyards
      attracted their covetous eyes. 
 A lake occupied the crater of an extinct volcano; the water was dark as ink, but this was
      due rather to the character of the bottom, than to depth, which was inconsiderable. 
 The villa and its gardens lay by the water’s edge. The old city not flourishing, but
      maintaining a languid existence, was famous for nothing but a peculiarity in girding the toga
      adopted by the men, by the dingi
      ness of its building stone, and by its temple of Juno, an object of pilgrimage
      when the deities of other shrines had proved unwilling or unable to help, a sort of pis-aller
      of devotion. 
 Longa Duilia hated the place; it was dull, and she would never have frequented it, had it
      not been the fashion at the period for all people of good family to affect a love of
      retirement into the country, and to pretend a taste for simplicity of rural life. Some fine
      fops had their “chambers of poverty” to which on occasions they retired, to lie on mats upon
      the ground, and eat pulse out of common earthenware. Such periods of self-denial added zest to
      luxury. 
 Domitia, on the other hand, was attached to the place. It was associated with the innocent
      pleasures of earliest childhood. Its spring flowers were the loveliest she had ever culled,
      its June strawberries the most delicious she had ever eaten. And the lake teeming with char
      gave opportunities for boating and fishing. 
 Here was the family burial-place; and here Corbulo was to be burnt, and then his ashes
      collected and consigned to the mausoleum. 
 Messengers had been sent forth to invite the attendance of all relations, acquaintances and
      dependents. 
 The invitation was couched, according to unalterable custom, in antiquated terms, hardly
      intelligible. When on the day appointed for the ceremony, vast numbers were collected, the
      funeral procession started. 
 First went the musicians under the conduct of a Master of the Ceremonies. By law, the
      number of flautists was limited to ten. 
 Then followed the professional mourners, hired for the occasion from the temple of
      Libitina, the priests
      of which were the licensed undertakers. These mourners chanted the
      nænia, a lament composed for the purpose of lauding the acts of the deceased and of reciting
      his honors. When they paused at the conclusion of a strophe, horns and trumpets brayed.
      Immediately after the wailers walked a train of actors, one of whom was dressed in the
      insignia of the deceased and wore a mask representing him. He endeavored to mimic each
      peculiarity of the man he personated, and buffoons around by their antics and jests provoked
      the spectators to laughter. This farcical exhibition was calculated to moderate the excessive
      grief superinduced by the lament of the wailers. 
 Then came the grand procession of the ancestors, especially dear to the heart of the
       widow. Not only did the effigies of the direct forefathers appear, but all
      related families trotted out their ancestors, to attend the illustrious dead, so that there
      cannot have been less than a hundred present. 
 As already mentioned, the wax masks of the dead of a family ornamented every nobleman’s
      hall, usually enclosed in boxes with the titles of the defunct inscribed on them in gold
      characters. These were now produced. The mimes were costumed appropriately, as senators,
      generals, magistrates, with their attendants, wearing the wax masks, and artificial heads of
      hair. 
 The idea represented was that of the ancestors having returned from the land of Shadows to
      fetch their descendant and accompany him to the nether world. The corpse, that lay on a bier
      in the hall, was now taken up, and carried forth to a loud cry from all in the house of “Vale!
      Farewell! Fare thee well!” Between the lips of the dead man was a coin, placed there as
      payment
      of the toll across the River of Death in the ferry-boat of Charon. On each side of
      the bier walked attendants carrying lighted torches. In ancient times all funerals had been
      conducted at night. Now the only reminiscence of this custom was in the bearing of lights; but
      the torches served as well a practical purpose, as they were employed to kindle the pyre. 
 Before the dead were carried the insignia of his offices, pictures of the battles he had
      won and statues of the kings and chiefs he had conquered. The corpse was followed by a number
      of manumitted slaves, all wearing the cap of liberty, in token of their freedom. Finally came
      the members of the family, friends, retainers, and the sympathizing public. 
 Longa Duilia and Domitia Longina walked in their proper place, with dishevelled hair,
      unveiled heads, and in the ricinium or black garment thrown over their
      tunics; the men all wore the pænula, or short travelling cloak. 
 The procession advanced into the marketplace of Gabii, where Lucius Lamia ascended the
       rostrum to pronounce the funeral oration. 
 Immediately, ivory chairs and inlaid stools were ranged in a crescent before him, and on
      these the ancestors seated themselves, the bier being placed before them. 
 The panegyric was addressed to the crowd outside the circle of mimes with wax faces. Lamia
      had a gift of natural eloquence, his feelings were engaged, but his freedom of speech was
      hampered by necessity of caution in allusion to the death of Corbulo, lest some word should be
      let slip which might be caught up and tortured into a treasonable reference to Nero. 
 The Laudation ended, the entire assembly arose and re-formed in procession to the place of
      burning, which by law must be sixty feet from any building. There a pit had been excavated and
      a grating placed above it. On this grating the pyre was erected, consisting of precious woods,
      sprinkled with gums and spices. 
 To this the corpse was conveyed. But, previous to its being placed on the fagots, a surgeon
      amputated one of the fingers, which was preserved for burial, and then a handful of earth was
      thrown over the face of the deceased. 
 Anciently the Roman dead had been buried, and when the fashion for incineration came in, a
      trace of the earlier usage remained in the burial of a member and the covering of the face
      with soil. 
 And now ensued a repulsive scene, one without which no great man’s funeral would have been
      considered as properly performed. 
 Through the crowd pushed two small parties of gladiators, three in each, hired for the
      occasion of a company that let them out. Then ensued a fight—not mimic, but very real, in
      front and round the pyre. Now a hard-pressed gladiator ran and was pursued, turned sharply and
      hacked at his follower. This was continued till three men had fallen and had been stabbed in
      the breast. Whereupon, the survivors sheathed their swords, bowed and withdrew. 
 The torches were now put into the hands of Duilia and Domitia, and with averted faces they
      applied the fire to the fagot, and a sheet of flame roared up and enveloped the dead man. 
 And now the mourners raised their loudest cries, tore their hair, scarified their cheeks
      with their nails;
      pipes, flutes, horns were blown. In a paroxysm of distress, partly real, partly
      feigned, a rush was made to the pyre, and all who got near cast some offering into the
      flames—cakes, flowers, precious stuffs, rings, bracelets, and coins. 
 Duilia, in tragic woe, disengaged a mass of artificial hair from her head, and cast it into
      the fire. Then rang out the sacramental cry:—“I, licet! You are permitted
      to retire,” and gladly, sick at heart and faint, Domitia was supported rather than walked
      home. 
 Some hours later, when the ashes of the defunct had been collected and deposited in an urn,
      which was conveyed to the mausoleum, Lucius Lamia came to the house and inquired for the
      ladies. 
 He was informed that the widow was too much overcome by her feelings to see any one, but
      that Domitia was in the tablinum and would receive him. 
 He at once entered the hall and stepped up into the apartment where she was seated, looking
      pale and worn, with tear-reddened eyes. 
 She rose, and with a sweet sad smile, extended her hand to Lamia. 
 “No, Domitia,” said he gently, “as your dear father gave me permission on the wharf at
      Cenchræa, I will claim the same privilege now.” 
 She held her cold, tear-stained cheek to him without a word, then returned to and sank on
      her stool. 
 “I thank you, dear friend, and almost brother,” she said. “You spoke nobly of my father,
      though not more nobly than he deserved. Here, my Lucius, is a present for you, I intrust it to
      you—his sword, which he used so gallantly, on which he fell, and still marked with his blood.” 
 According to an Oriental legend, the dominion of Solomon over the spirits resided in the
      power of his staff on which he stayed himself. So long as he wielded that, none might disobey. 
 But the Jins sent a white ant up through the floor, that ate out the heart of the rod, so
      that when he leaned on it, it gave way and resolved itself into a cloud of fine powder.
      Solomon fell, and his authority was at an end forever. 
 The termites that consumed the core of the sceptre of Nero were his own vices and follies.
      Its power was at an end and his fall as sudden as in the case of Solomon, and as unexpected. 
 In March he was possessed of dominion over the world, and was at the head of incalculable
      forces. In June all was dissolved in the dust of decay; he was prostrate, helpless, bereft of
      the shadow of authority, unable to command a single slave. The first token of what was about
      to take place was this. 
 In Rome the rabble was kept in good humor by the Cæsars distributing among them bread
      gratis, and entertaining them with shows free of charge. 
 During the winter, contrary winds had delayed the corn-ships from Egypt, and the amount of
      bread distributed was accordingly curtailed. Games were, in
      deed, promised, but these would serve as condiments to the bread and not as
      substitutes. Then a vessel arrived in port, and the hungry people believed that she was laden
      with the wished-for corn. When, however, they learned that her cargo was white sand for
      strewing the arena at the sports, they broke into a storm of discontent and swept, howling
      insulting words, under Nero’s windows. 
 Next day all Rome heard that Galba, at the head of the legions of Spain and Gaul, was
      marching into Italy, and that none of the troops of Nero sent to guard the frontier of the
      Alps would draw a sword in his defence. 
 The prince, now only seriously alarmed, bade his household guard conduct him to Ostia,
      where he would mount the vessel that had discharged its load of sand, and escape to Egypt.
      They contemptuously refused, and disbanded. Then, in an agony of fear, Nero left the Palatine,
      and fled across the river to the Servilian mansion that adjoined the racecourse, to light
      which he had burned Christians swathed in tarred wraps. 
 There he found none save his secretary Epaphroditus, whom he had sent there to be chained
      at the door, and to act as porter because he had offended him. Guards, freedmen, courtiers,
      actors, all had taken to their heels, but not before they had pillaged the palace. 
 He wandered about the house, knocking at every door, and nowhere meeting with an answer. 
 Night by this time had settled in, murk and close, but at intervals electric flashes
      shivered overhead. 
 Then suddenly the earth reeled, and there passed a sound as of chariot wheels rolling
      heavily through the streets; yet the streets were deserted. Trembling, despairing, Nero
      crouched on his bed, bit his nails till
      he had gnawed them to the quick, then started up and hunted for his jewel case. He
      would fly on foot, carrying that, hide in some hovel, till danger was past. But a thievish
      slave had stolen it. 
 Sick at heart, picking, then biting at his nails, shrinking with apprehension at the least
      noise, wrapping a kerchief about a finger where blood came, he looked with dazed eyes at the
      red flare of the heavenly fires pulsating through his open door. 
 He heard a step and ran out, to encounter a freedman, Phaon by name, who was coming along
      the passage, holding aloft a torch, attended by two slaves. 
 The wretched prince clung to him, and entreated that he might not be left alone; that Phaon
      would protect him, and contrive a means of escape. 
 “Augustus!” answered the freedman, “I am not ungrateful for favors shown me, but my
      assistance at this hour is unavailing. I am but one man, a stranger, a Greek, and all Rome,
      all Italy, the entire world, have risen against you.” 
 “I must fly. They will allow me to earn my livelihood on the stage. Of what value to any
      man is my life?” 
 “My lord, in what value have you held the lives of the thousands that you have taken? Each
      life cut off has raised against you a hundred enemies. All will pursue, like a pack of hounds
      baying for the blood of him who murdered their kinsfolk. Even now I passed one—Lucius Ælius
      Lamia,—and he stayed me to inquire where you might be found. In his hand he held an unsheathed
      sword.” 
 Nero shrieked out; then looked timidly about him, terrified at the sound of his own voice. 
 “Let us hide. Disguise me. Get me a horse. I cannot run, I am too fat; besides, I have on
      my felt slippers only.” 
 Phaon spoke to one of his slaves, and the man left. 
 “Master,” said the freedman, “Do not deceive yourself. There is no escape. Prepare to die
      as a man. Slay yourself. It is not hard to die. Better so fall than get into the hands of
      implacable enemies.” 
 “I cannot. I have not the courage. I will do it only when everything fails. I have many
      theatrical wigs. I can paint my face.” 
 “Sire! the people are so wont to see your face besmeared with color, that they are less
      likely to recognize a face bleached to tallow.” 
 “I have a broad-brimmed fisherman’s hat. I wear it against becoming freckled. That will
      shade my face. Find me an ample cloak. Here, at length, comes Sporus.” 
 An eunuch appeared in the doorway. 
 Breathless, in short, broken sentences, Nero entreated him to look out in his wardrobe for
      a sorry mantle, and to bring it him. 
 “But whither will—can you go?” asked Phaon. “The Senate has been assembled—it has been
      convoked for midnight to vote your deposition and death.” 
 “I will go before it. Nay! I will haste to the Forum, I will mount the Tribune. I will ask
      to be given the government of Egypt. That at least will not be refused me.” 
 “My lord, the streets are filling with people. They will tear you to pieces ere you reach
      the Forum.” 
 “Think you so! Why so? I have amused the people so well. Good Phaon, hire me a swift
      galley, and I will
      take refuge with Tiridates. I restored to him the crown of Armenia. He will not be
      ungrateful.” 
 “My lord, it will not be possible for you to leave Italy.” 
 “Then I will retire to a farm. I will grow cabbages and turnips. The god Tiberius was fond
      of turnips. O Divine Powers that rule the fate of men! shall I ever eat turnips again? Phaon,
      hide me for a season. Men’s minds are changeable. They are heated now. They will cool
      to-morrow. They cannot kill such a superlative artist as myself.” 
 “I have a villa between the Salarian and the Nomentane Roads. If it please you to go
      thither——” 
 “At once. I think I hear horse-hoofs. O Phaon, save me!” 
 Sporus came up, offering an old moth-eaten cloak. The wardrobe had been plundered, only the
      refuse had been abandoned. 
 A voice was heard pealing through the empty corridors: “Horses! horses at the door!” 
 “Who calls so loud? Silence him. He will betray us!” said Nero. “Hah! It is Epaphroditus.” 
 At the entrance, chained to a cumbrous log, was the Greek, Epaphroditus, formerly a
      pampered favorite. But two days previously he had ventured to correct a false quantity in some
      verses by his master, and Nero, in a burst of resentment and mortified vanity, had ordered him
      to be fastened to a beam as doorkeeper to the Servilian Palace. 
 “The horses are here,” shouted the freedman. “May it please my lord to mount. Sporus and
      the slaves can run afoot.” 
 Nero unwound the kerchief from his hand and
      wrapped it about his throat, drew the broad-brimmed hat over his head, enveloped
      himself in the blanket cloak, and shuffled in his slippers to the door. 
 The chained Greek at once cried out: “Master! my chain has become entangled and is so
      knotted that I cannot stir. I have been thus since noon, and none have regarded me. I pray
      thee, let me go.” 
 “Thou fool! cease hallooing!” retorted Nero angrily. “Dost think I carry about with me the
      key of thy shackles?” Then to those who followed, “Smite him on the mouth and silence him, or
      he will call attention to me.” 
 “The gods smite thee!” yelled the scribe, striving to reach an upright posture, but falling
      again, owing to the tangle in the links. “May they blight thee as they have stricken Livia’s
       laurel!”
     
 Mounted on an old gray horse, Nero rode to the Ælian Bridge, where stands now that of St.
      Angelo, crossed it and began to traverse the Campus Martius. 
 Electric flashes quivered across the sky. Then again an earthquake made the city rock as if
      drunk; the buildings were rent, and masses of cornice fell down. 
 A glare of white lightning illumined the whole field and lighted up the mausoleum of
      Augustus, and the blank faces of such men as were abroad. 
 The horse trembled and refused to move. It was some time before the alarm of the brute
      could be allayed, and it could be coaxed to go forward and begin the ascent of the Quirinal.
      The advance was slow; and Nero’s fears became greater as the road
      approached the Prætorian Camp, and he expected recognition by the sentinels. Yet
      in the midst of his fear wild flashes of hope shot, and he said to Phaon: 
 “What think you, if I were to enter the camp? Surely the Prætorians would rally about me,
      and I might dissolve the Senate.” 
 “Sire, they have destroyed your images, and have proclaimed Galba. They would take off your
      head and set it on a pike.” 
 Nero uttered a groan, and kicked the flanks of his steed. At that moment a passer-by
      saluted him. 
 “By the Immortals! I am recognized.” 
 “We have but to go a little further.” 
 “Phaon, what if the Senate declare me an enemy of the State?” 
 “Then you will fare in the customary manner.” 
 “How is that?” 
 The prince put his trembling hand to his brow and in his agitation knocked off his hat. 
 The freedman picked it up. 
 “The customary manner, sire! your neck will be put in the cleft of a forked stick and you
      will be beaten, lashed, kicked to death. Better take the sword and fall on it.” 
 “Oh, Phaon! not yet! I cannot endure pain. I have a spring nail now—and it hurts! it
      hurts!” 
 “Ride on, my lord; at the cypress hedge we will turn our horses loose, and by a path
      through the fields reach my villa.” 
 Half an hour after Nero had left the Servilian palace, where now stands the Lateran, Lamia
      arrived followed by two servants. He found the secretary in a heap at the door, vainly
      writhing in his knotted chains. Lamia
      at once asked him about the prince, whether he was there. 
 “I will both answer and show you whither he is fled,” said Epaphroditus, “if you will
      release me. Otherwise my tongue is tied like my limbs.” 
 “Is he here?” 
 “Nay, he has been here, but is gone. Whither I alone can say. The price of the information
      is release.” 
 “Tell me where I can find tools.” 
 Epaphroditus gave the required information and Lamia despatched a servant to bring hammer
      and chisel. They were speedily produced; but some time was taken up in cutting through the
      links. 
 This, however, was finally effected, and the secretary gathered up a handful of the broken
      chain and clenched it in his fist. 
 “Now I will lead the way,” said he, stretching himself. 
 The wretched, fallen emperor had in the meanwhile scrambled through hedges and waded
      through a marsh, and had at last found a temporary shelter in a garden tool-house of the
      villa. Phaon feared to introduce him into his house. 
 Wearied out, he cast himself on a sort of bier on which the gardeners carried citron trees
      to and from the conservatory. The cloak had fallen from him and lay on the soil. 
 His feet were muddy and bleeding. He had tried to eat some oat-cake that had been offered
      him, but was unable to swallow. 
 He continued to be teased with, and to pick or bite at his spring nails. 
 “I hear steps!” he cried. “They will kill me!” 
 “Sire, play the man.” 
 Phaon offered him a couple of poniards. 
 Nero put the point of one to his breast, shrunk and threw it away. 
 “It is too blunt, it will not enter,” he said. 
 He tried the other and dropped it. 
 “It is over sharp. It cuts,” he said. 
 At that moment the door opened and Lamia and Epaphroditus entered. 
 Nero cried out and covered his face: 
 “Sporus! Phaon! one or both! kill yourselves and show me how to do it.” 
 “To do it!” said Lamia sternly. “That is not difficult. Do you need a sword? Here is
      one—the sword of Corbulo.” 
 He extended the weapon to the prince, who accepted it with tremulous hand, looking at Lamia
      with glassy eyes. 
 “Oh! a moment! I feel sick.” 
 Then Phaon said: “Sire—at once!” 
 Then Nero, with all power going out of his fingers, pointed the blade to his throat. 
 “I cannot,” he gasped, “my hand is numb.” 
 Immediately, Epaphroditus with his hand full of chain, brought the weighted fist against
      the haft, and drove the sword into the coward’s throat. 
 He sank back on the bier. 
 Then Lamia stooped, gathered up the moth-eaten cloak, and threw it over the face of the
      dying man. 
 “Push, my dear Domitia, Push. Of course. What else would you have, but Push?” 
 “But, sweetest mother, that surely cannot give what I ask.” 
 “Indeed, my child, it does. It occupies all one’s energies, it exerts all one’s faculties,
      and it fills the heart.” 
 “But—what do you gain?” 
 “Gain, child?—everything. The satisfaction of having got further up the ladder; of exciting
      the envy of your late companions, the admiration of the vulgar, the mistrust of those above
      you.” 
 “Is that worth having?” 
 “Of course it is. It is—that very thing you desire, Happiness. It engages all your
      thoughts, stimulates your abilities. You dress for it; you prepare your table for it,
      accumulate servants for it, walk, smile, talk, acquire furniture, statuary, bronzes, and so
      on—for it. It is charming, ravishing. I live for it. I desire nothing better.” 
 “But I do, mother. I do not care for this.” 
 The girl spoke with her eyes on a painting on the wall of the atrium that represented a
      young maiden running in pursuit of a butterfly. Beneath it were the words “Ubi Felicitas?” 
 “Because you are young and silly, Domitia. When older and wiser, you will understand the
      value of Push, and appreciate Position. My dear, properly considered, everything can be made
      use of for the purpose—even widowhood, dexterously dealt with, becomes a vehicle for Push. It
      really is vexatious that in Rome there should just now be such broils and effervescence of
      minds, proclamation of emperors, cutting of throats, that I, poor thing, here in Gabii run a
      chance of being forgotten. It is too provoking. I really wish that this upsetting of Nero, and
      setting up of Galba, and defection of Otho, and so on, had been postponed till my year of
      widowhood were at an end. One gets no chance, and it might have been so effective.” 
 “And when you have obtained that at which you have aimed?” 
 “Then make that the start for another push.” 
 “And if you fail?” 
 “Then, my dear, you have the gratification of being able to lay the blame on some one else.
      You have done your utmost.” 
 “When you have gained what you aimed at, you are not content.” 
 “That is just the beauty of Push. No, always go on to what is beyond.” 
 “Look at that running girl, mother, she chases a butterfly, and when she has caught the
      lovely insect she crushes it in her hand. The glory of its wings is gone, its life is at an
      end. What then?” 
 “She runs after another butterfly.” 
 “And despises and rejects each to which she has attained?” 
 “Certainly!” 
 After a pause Longa Duilia said, as she signed to Lucilla the slave to fan her, “That was
      the one defect in your dear father’s character, he had no Push.” 
 “Mother! can you say that after his splendid victories, over the Chauci, over the
      Parthians, over——” 
 “I know all about them. They should have served as means, child, not as ends.” 
 “I do not understand.” 
 “Poor simple man, he fought the enemies of Rome and defeated them, because it was, as he
      said, his duty to his country, to Rome, to do so. But, by Ops and Portumna! that was talking
      like a child. What might he not have been with those victories? But he couldn’t see it. He had
      it not in him. Some men are born to squint; some have club feet; and your poor dear father had
      no ambition.” 
 After a pause the lady added: “When I come to consider what he might have done for me, had
      he possessed Push, it makes my spleen swell. Just consider! What is Galba compared with him?
      What any of these fellows who have been popping up their heads like carp or trout when the May
      flies are about? My dear, had your dear father been as complete a man as I am a woman, at this
      moment I might be Empress.” 
 “That would have contented you.” 
 “It would have been a step in that direction.” 
 “What more could you desire?” 
 “Why, to be a goddess. Did not the Senate pronounce Poppæa divine, and to be worshipped and
      invoked, after Nero had kicked her and she died? And that baby of his—it died of fits in
      teething—that became a goddess also. Nasty little thing! I saw it, it
      did nothing but dribble and squall, but is a god for all that. My dear Domitia,
      think! the Divine Duilia! Salus Italiæ, with my temples, my altars, my statues. By the
      Immortal Twelve, I think I should have tried to cut out Aphrodite, and have been represented
      rising from the foam. Oh! it would have been too, too lovely. But there! it makes me mad—all
      that might have been, and would have been to a certainty, had your dear
      father listened to me at Antioch. But he had a head.” She touched her brow. “Something wrong
      there—no Push.” 
 “But, dearest mother, this may be an approved motive for such as you and for all nobles.
      But then—for the artisan, the herdsman, the slave, Push can’t be a principle of life to such
      as they.” 
 “My child, how odd you are! What need we consider them? They may have their own motives, I
      can’t tell; I never was a herdsman nor a slave—never did any useful work in my life. As to a
      slave, of course Push is a motive—he pushes to gain his freedom.” 
 “And when he has got that?” 
 “Then he strives to accumulate a fortune.” 
 “And then?” 
 “Then he will have a statue or a bust of himself sculptured, and when he gets old, erect a
      splendid mausoleum.” 
 “And so all ends in a handful of dust.” 
 “Of course. What else would you have?—Remember, a splendid mausoleum.” 
 “Yes, enclosing a pot of ashes. That picture teaches a sad truth. Pursue your butterfly:
      when you have caught it, you find only dust between your fingers.” 
 “Domitia! as the Gods love me! I wish you would
      refrain from this talk. It is objectionable. It is prematurely oldening you, and
      what ages you reflects on me—it advances my years. I will listen to no more of this. If you
      relish it, I do not; go, chatter to the Philosopher Claudius Senecio, he is paid to talk this
      stuff.” 
 “I will not speak to him. I know beforehand what he will say.” 
 “He will give you excellent advice, he is hired to do it.” 
 “O yes—to bear everything with equanimity. That is the sum and substance of his doctrine.
      Then not to be too wise about the Gods; to aim to sit on the fulcrum of a see-saw, when I
      prefer an end of the plank.” 
 “Equanimity! I desire it with my whole soul.” 
 “But why so, mother? It is not running thought, but stagnation.” 
 “Because, my dear, it keeps off wrinkles.” 
 “Mother, you and I will never understand each other.” 
 “As the Gods love me, I sincerely hope not. Send me Plancus, Lucilla. I must scold him so
      as to soothe my ruffled spirits.” 
 “And, Euphrosyne, go, send the Chaldæan to me in the garden,” said the girl. 
 The slave obeyed and departed. 
 “Ubi Felicitas? Running, pursuing and finding nothing,” said Domitia as she went forth. 
 The sun was hot. She passed under an arched trellis with vines trained over it; the
      swelling bunches hung down within. 
 At intervals in the arcade were openings through
      which could be seen the still lake, and beyond the beautiful ridges of the
      limestone Sabine Mountains. The air was musical with the hum of bees. 
 Domitia paced up and down this walk for some while. 
 Presently the Magus appeared at the end, under the guidance of the girl Euphrosyne. 
 He approached, bowing at intervals, till he reached Domitia, when he stood still. 
 “Ubi Felicitas?” asked she. And when he raised his eyebrows in question, she added in
      explanation: “There is a picture in the atrium representing a damsel in pursuit of a
      butterfly, and beneath is the legend I have just quoted. When she catches the butterfly it
      will not content her. It will be a dead pinch of dust. It is now some months since you spoke
      on the Artemis, when I asked you a question, and then you were forced to admit that all your
      science was built up on conjecture, and that there was no certainty underlying it. But a guess
      is better than nothing, and a guess that carries the moral sense with it in approval, may come
      near to the truth. I recall all you then said. Do not repeat it, but answer my question,
       Ubi Felicitas? I asked it of my mother, and she said that it was to be
      found in Push. If I asked Senecio, he would say in Equanimity. Where say you that it is to be
      found?” 
 “The soul of man is a ray out of the Godhead,” answered the Magus, “it is enveloped,
      depressed, smothered by matter; and the straining of the spirit in man after happiness is the
      striving of his divine nature to emancipate itself from the thraldom of matter and return to
      Him from whom the ray emanated.” 
 “Then felicity is to be found—?” 
 “In the disengagement of the good in man from matter, which presses it down, and which is
      evil.” 
 “Evil!” exclaimed Domitia, looking through one of the gaps in the arcade, at the lake; on a
      balustrade above the water stood a dreaming peacock, whilst below it grew bright flowers.
      Beyond, as clouds, hung the blue Sabine hills. 
 “The Divine ray,” said the girl, “seems rarely to delight in its incorporation in Matter,
      and to find therein its expression, much as do our thoughts in words. May it not be that
      Primordial Idea is inarticulate without Matter in which to utter itself?” 
 “Felicity,” continued the Chaldæan, disregarding the objection, “is sought by many in the
      satisfying of their animal appetites, in pleasing eye and ear and taste and smell. But in all
      is found the after-taste of satiety that gluts. True happiness is to be sought in teaching the
      mind to dispense with sensuous delights, and to live in absorption in itself.” 
 “Why, Elymas!” said Domitia. “In fine, you arrive by another method at that Apathy which
      Senecio the Stoic advocates. I grant you give a reason—which seems to me lame—but it is a
      reason, whereas he supplies none. But I like not your goal—Apathy is the reverse from
      Felicity. Leave me.” 
 The Magus retired, mortified at his doctrine being so ill received. 
 Then Euphrosyne approached timidly. 
 Domitia, who was in moody thought, looked up. The girl could not venture to speak till
      invited to do so by her mistress. 
 “Your lady mother has desired me to announce to
      you that Lucius Ælius Lamia hath ridden over from Rome.” 
 “I will come presently,” said Domitia; “I am just now too troubled in mind. You, child,
      tell me, where is the physician, Luke?” 
 “Lady, I do not know; he quitted us on reaching Rome.” 
 “Stay, Euphrosyne. Thine is a cheerful spirit. Where is felicity to be found?” 
 “My gracious mistress, I find mine in serving thee—in my duty.” 
 “Ah, child! That is the sort of reply my father might have made. In the discharge of what
      he considered his duty, he was of a wondrous sweet and equable temper. Is it so, that Felicity
      is only to be found in the discharge of duty? And those torpid flies, the young loafers of our
      noble families, whose only occupation is to play ball, and whose amusements are vicious; they
      have it not because none has set them tasks. The ploughman whistles as he drives his team; the
      vineyard rings with laughter at the gathering of the grapes. The galley-slaves chant as they
      bend over the oar, and the herdboy pipes as he tends the goats. So each is set a task, and is
      content in discharge thereof, and each sleeps sweetly at night, when the task is done. But
      what! is happiness reserved to the bondsman, and not for the master? And only then for the
      former when the duty imposed is reasonable and honest?—For there is none when such an order
      comes as to fall on the sword or to open the veins. How about us great ladies? And the noble
      loafers? No task is set us and them.” 
 “Surely, lady, to all God has given duties!” 
 “Nay—when, where, how? Look at me, Euphrosyne. When I was a little child here, we had a
      neighbor, Lentulus. He was a lie-abed, and a sot. He let his servants do as they liked, make
      love, quarrel, fight, the one lord it over the other, and all idle, because on none was
      imposed any duty. It was a villainous household, and the estate went to the hammer. It seems
      to me, Euphrosyne, as if this whole world were the estate of Lentulus on a large scale, where
      all the servants squabbled, and one by sheer force tyrannizes over the others, and none know
      why they are placed there, and what is their master’s will, and what they have to do. There is
      no day-table of work. There is either no master over such a household, or he is an Olympian
      Lentulus.” 
 “But, mistress, is that not impossible?” 
 “It would seem so, and yet—Where is the Day-Table? Show me that—and, by the Gods! it will
      be new life to me. I shall know my duty—and see Happiness.” 
 Domitia did not go into the house, as desired, to receive Lamia. 
 She was well aware that he would come to her into the garden, if she did not present
      herself within, and she preferred to speak with him away from her mother. 
 She therefore continued to walk under the vines. She looked up at the sunlight filtering
      through the broad green flaky shade, with here and there a ray kissing a purple, pendent bunch
      of grapes. 
 Then she looked at the dreaming peacock, the sun flashing on its metallic plumage. 
 No! matter was not evil. Matter, indeed, without life was not even like the statue—for that
      was a copy of what lived, and failed just in this, that it fell short of life. Domitia felt as
      though she were touching the edge of a great verity, but had not set her foot upon it. Then
      she considered what Euphrosyne had said to her, and she to her slave. Wherever the path of
      duty lay, there violets bloomed and verbena scented the air. Was not life itself, devoid of
      the knowledge of its purport, and its obligations and its destiny, like matter uninformed by
      Life? Or if any life entered into it, it was the disintegrating life of decay and
      decomposition? 
 She, for her part, had no obligations laid on her.
      If, however, she were married to Lamia, then at once duties would spring up, and
      her way would be rosy. Till then her happiness hung in suspense, like that of her mother,
      during the period of widowhood in which she was expected and required to live in retirement.
      Out of society, not elbowing and shouldering her way forward—that was a year of blank and of
      unhappiness to Longa Duilia, in which she found no consolation save in badgering her steward,
      and in scheming for the future. 
 Lamia, as Domitia expected he would, came to her under the trellis, and she received him
      with that dimple in her cheek which gave her expression so much sweetness mingled with pathos, 
 “Lucius,” she said, “you are good to come. My mother is, oh! so dull, and restless withal.” 
 “It is well that she should be away from Rome, my Domitia. I have told her as much. On no
      account must you leave Gabii. Rome is boiling over, and will scald many fingers. None know who
      will be up to-morrow, and which down. Galba is dead, almost torn to pieces by those who
      worshipped him yesterday. Otho is proclaimed by the Senate. Yet there is fresh trouble brewing
      and threats sound from the provinces. Methinks every general at the head of an army is
      marching upon Rome to snatch the purple for his own shoulders. Otho has but a poor chance. He
      can command the prætorians and the household troops—none others. Soldiers that
      have disbanded themselves and gangs of robbers prowl the streets, waylay men of substance and
      plunder them, break into houses and strip them of their contents. Murders are frequent. Thus
      far your palace in the Carinæ is undisturbed.” 
 “Oh, Lucius! my mother has so fretted over that house, as it stands back, and makes no show
      behind its bank of yews and laurels, and yet those evergreens, I believe, saved it in the
      fire. She says that the house is unworthy of our dignity.” 
 “You may rejoice that it is so in such times of anarchy. Order in the city is now at an
      end, none are safe unless attended by armed slaves; and, by the Gods! no man is quite safe
      even from his own slaves.” 
 “What did my mother say to that?” 
 “She sighed and said—” there was a twinkle in Lamia’s eye, “that she was glad the
      disturbances were taking place now, as at no time could they have happened so happily, when
      she was obliged to live in retirement.” 
 “Lucius, what do you think will be the end?” 
 “That the gods alone can tell. At present the soldiers are masters in the State, and the
      Senate proclaims whomsoever they set up. Rome is dishonored in the face of the Barbarians.” 
 “What think you, my Lucius,—shall we ask the Chaldee if he can unveil the future?” 
 “Not of the State, Domitia, that were too dangerous. Women have lost their lives, or been
      banished on such a charge. No, do not risk it.” 
 “Nay, Lucius, like my mother, the State concerns me only so far as its affairs affect my
      own silly little interests. But I do want to know something of my future. Elymas is reputed to
      look into destiny. He hath glimpses beyond the strain of a philosopher’s eye. I have offended
      him by my quips and objections, and would humor him now by asking him to read in the
      stars, or where he will, what the gods have in store for me.” 
 “I believe not in such vision.” 
 “Nor I greatly, Lucius. Yet I heard say that he had prognosticated evil on the day my dear
      father set foot in Cenchræa.” 
 “It needed no prophet to foretell that.” 
 “Shall we seek him, Lucius?” 
 “As you will. I will attend thee. Only, no questions relative to the prince, as to his
      life, his reign, his health. No questions concerning the State—promise me that.” 
 “It shall be so, Lucius. Come with me to the Temple of Isis. He is there.” 
 The two young people walked to a small shrine or ædiculum at the extremity of a terrace
      above the lake. 
 In the colonnade in front of the door was the Magus. He was out of humor, offended at his
      treatment by Domitia. His sole satisfaction was that Senecio, the Stoic, was placed below him
      in her estimation. 
 Now the girl went up to him, with a pretty, winning smile, and said: 
 “Sir! I fear me greatly that I gave you occasion to think I held your theories cheaply.
      Indeed it is not so, they are too weighty to be dismissed at once; they take time to digest.
      There is one thing you may do for me, that I desire of you heartily, and in which I will not
      controvert your authority. It is said that the stars rule the destinies of men, and that in
      the far East, on the boundless plains of Mesopotamia, you and your people have learned to read
      them. I would fain know what the heavens have in store for me.” 
 “Indeed, lady, to consult the stars is a long and
      painful business, that I will gladly undertake, but it cannot be done hastily. It
      will require time. There are, however, other ways of reading the future than by the stars.
      There is Ishtar, whom the Egyptians call Isis, whom thou mayest consult in this temple.” 
 “I am ready.” 
 “That also cannot be undertaken at once. I must even send for my assistant Helena. It is
      not I who see, save mediately. The goddess has her chosen instrument, and such is Helena.
      Lady! Ishtar is the Truth, she has no image. She is invisible to us veiled in matter. She
      hides herself behind seven veils, or rather our eyes are so wrapped about that we cannot see
      her who is visible only in spirit. Thou knowest that in the Temple floor is a rent, and
      through that rent the breath of the gods ascends. I will place Helena over that rent, and she
      will fall into a trance, and if I say certain prayers and use certain invocations, then the
      veils will fall away, and in pure spiritual essence she will look into the face of Ishtar and
      read therein the Truth, past, present, and future. Is it your pleasure to consult the
      goddess?” 
 “Indeed I do desire it,” said Domitia. 
 “Thou hast no fear?” 
 “Fear! fear of what?” 
 “Of the future. It is well for us that the gods hide this from our eyes.” 
 Domitia turned and looked at Lamia. 
 “No,” she said with a smile, “I have no fear for my future.” 
 “That which is anticipated does not always come, but rather that which is unexpected.” 
 “Then when forewarned, one is forearmed.” 
 “If it be thy pleasure, lady, return at sunset. Then Helena shall be here, and I shall have
      made my preparations.” 
 “That is but an hour hence. Be it so. Come, Lamia. Thou shalt row me on the lake till
      Elymas call.” 
 “So be it,” said Lucius; and as they withdrew, he added, “I like that not. If it pleased
      the gods to show us what is in store, then they would reveal it to us. I mistrust me, this man
      is either an impostor or he deals with the spirits of evil.” 
 “Nay, think not so. Why should not the Truth lie behind seven veils, and if so, and we are
      able, why not pluck away those veils?” 
 “In good sooth, Domitia, thou hast more daring in thy little soul than have I.” 
 The girl and Lucius Lamia had been so much together in Syria, that they had come to regard
      each other with the affection of brother and sister. In Greek life the females occupied a
      separate portion of the house to the males, and did not partake of meals with them. There was
      no common family life. 
 Old Roman domestic arrangements had been very different from this. There the wife and
      mother occupied a place of dignity, with her daughters around her, and sat and span in the
      atrium, where also the men assembled. She prepared the meals, and partook of them with her
      husband, and the sisters with their brothers. The only difference between them at table was
      that the men reclined to eat, whereas the women sat on stools. But this home life, which had
      been so wholesome and so happy, in the luxury and wealth of the age at the fall of the
      Commonwealth and the rise
      of Imperialism, had become an element of demoralization. For the conversation of
      the men had grown shameless, the exhibitions at banquets of coarse drunkenness, and of dancing
      girls, and the singing of ribald songs by musicians, had driven away shame from the cheeks of
      the women, and corrupted the freshness of the children’s innocence. 
 Yet there were, through even the worst periods, households in which the healthy old Roman
      simplicity and familiarity between the sexes remained, good fathers and mothers who screened
      their children’s eyes from evil sights, devoted husbands and wives full of mutual reverence.
      Such had been the house of Corbulo, whether in Rome, or in Syria. He had been a strict and
      honorable soldier, and a strict and honorable father in his family. 
 Thus it was that Lucius Lamia, and Domitia had seen much of each other, and that affection
      for each other mingled with respect had grown up naturally and vigorously in their hearts. 
 And now Lucius was paddling on the glassy tarn. He used but little action. Occasionally he
      dipped the paddles, then allowed the skiff to glide forward till she ceased to be moving, when
      again he propelled her with one stroke. He was musing; so also was Domitia. 
 All at once he roused himself. 
 “Domitia,” said he, “Do you know that there is a rumor about that Nero is not dead, but has
      fled to the Parthians, and that he will return?” 
 “You do not say so!” The girl’s color died away. 
 “I do not believe it. It cannot be. The sword of your father would not bite so feebly as to
      let him live. Yet the tale is circulating. Men are uneasy—expecting something.” 
 “If he be dead and burnt, he cannot return.” 
 “No,” said Lucius, “he cannot return from the dead. And yet—there be strange rumors. Among
      the Christians, I am told, there has risen up a seer, who hath been taken with an ecstasy, and
      hath beheld wonderful visions. And this is reported, that he saw a beast arising out of the
      sea, having seven heads, and on each head a golden crown. And one of those heads, the fifth,
      received a death-wound. Then arose two other heads, and after them the wounded head arose once
      again and breathed fire and slaughter, and the second state was worse than the first.” 
 “But, Lucius, what can this signify?” 
 “They say it signifies the Empire of Rome, and that the heads are the princes, and the
      fifth head, that is wounded as unto death, but not slain, is Nero, and that after two have
      arisen, then he will return.” 
 Domitia shuddered. 
 “If he return, Lamia, he will not forget thee. Well, we will ourselves look behind the
      veils; that is better than hearing through others what some unknown prophet hath said. See, on
      the shore stands Elymas, calling us.” 
 Lucius and Domitia stepped out of the boat; he moored it to the side, and they walked
      together to the little temple. This was not one to which a college of priests was attached,
      nor even an ædiculum, with a guardian who had charge of it, to open it on special festivals;
      it had been erected by the father of Corbulo in deference to the wish of his wife, who had
      taken it into her head to become a votary of Isis, this having become a fashionable cult. But
      on her death the doors had been closed, and it had fallen into neglect, till the return of
      Longa Duilia from the East with the Chaldee Magus from Antioch. It was now fashionable to
      dabble in sorcery, and a distinguished lady liked to be able to talk of her Magus, to seek his
      advice, and, at table, air a superficial familiarity with the stars, and the Powers and Æons,
      the endless genealogies of emanations from the primæval and eternal Light. 
 Longa had engaged the Magus when at Antioch, but when somewhat summarily sent to Europe by
      her husband, she had not taken her Chaldæan magician with her. As, however, she had no wish to
      appear in Rome without him, she had laid it on her husband when he returned to bring the man
      with him, and if he did not return himself, to despatch the Magus to her. 
 On her arrival in the villa at Gabii, she had given up the temple of Isis to Elymas, and he
      had converted it into a place for study. 
 Before the door hung a heavy curtain, and this Lamia raised to allow Domitia to pass
      within. The interior would have been wholly dark, but that a brazier with glowing charcoal
      stood within, and into the fire the magician threw gums, that flamed up and diffused a
      fragrant smoke. 
 By the flicker Domitia observed that a bed was laid above a small fissure in the marble
      floor—a rent caused by earthquake—through which vapor of an intoxicating nature issued. 
 On this bed lay a woman, or rather a figure that Domitia took to be that of a woman, but it
      was covered with much drapery that concealed face and hands. 
 The brazier was near the head, and by it stood Elymas in a tall headdress, with horns
      affixed, that met in front. He wore a black garment reaching to the feet. 
 In the darkness nothing could be seen save his erect figure, and face shining out like a
      lamp, when he cast resinous drops on the fire, and the motionless couched form of the woman. 
 Domitia, somewhat frightened, put her hand on the arm of Lamia, to make sure that he was
      present and could assist her, should need for assistance arise;—that is to say, should her
      courage fail, or the visions she expected to see prove too alarming. 
 Then the Magus said: 
 “As I have told thee, lady, out of the ineffable Light stream rays that are both luminous
      and life-producing. These rays penetrate to the lowest profundity of
      matter, and as they pass through the higher atmospheres, gather about them the
      particles of vapor, and become angels and demons. But other rays passing further down, and
      assuming grosser envelopes, become men and women, some more animal than others, some with
      higher spiritual natures than the rest, according as in them matter or spirit dominates. And
      the rays darting into further depths become the beasts of the field, the fishes of the sea,
      even the very worm that bores in the soil. As thou knowest, he who stands on a high mountain
      can see far horizons to right and to left as well as the objects below him. So, to the
      Eternal, all is visible, the past on one side, the present before Him, and the future on the
      other side, all in one vision. To Him there is no past, and no present, and no future, for
      Time is not—all is comprehended in one view. But we, who are below, see only the present,
      remember the past, and conjecture what is future. If we would see future as well as past, we
      must rise above matter, mount from our base level to the altitude of spirit. Thence all is
      clear. But this is not possible to all, only to those elect ones in whom the flesh is subdued,
      and to it the spirit remains attached only by a fibre. Such is Helena. Through her thou shalt
      see what thou desirest. Now behold!” 
 He pointed into the darkness before him, and both Domitia and Lucius saw a spark that grew
      in intensity and shone like a star. 
 “That,” said Elymas, “is a crystal. It is the lens through which the rays of the Eternal
      and Immortal Light pass to the soul of Helena, out of Infinite Altitude and Illimitable Space.
      She is enveloped in seven veils. Now she lieth in a trance, and seeth naught.
      But I will invoke this Fount of Life and Light and Knowledge, and will gather the
      rays together into her soul through yonder crystal, and she will see in vision what thou
      desirest. Seven veils cover her, and seven are the revelations that will be made. I cannot
      assure thee that all will be future—some may be scenes of the past, for to the All-Seeing, the
      Eye of Eternity, there is neither past nor future; all is present.” 
 “Well, so be it,” said Lamia, “By the past we can judge the future. Let us see things that
      have been and we can form some notion of what is shown us as future. If the one be incorrect,
      then the other is untrustworthy.” 
 “Thou shalt behold nothing,” said the Magus, “for it is not thou who consultest me, but the
      lady Domitia Longina.” 
 “How shall I see, and not he who stands beside me?” asked the girl. Her heart fluttered
      with apprehension. 
 The sorcerer stooped, and drew from under the covering the right hand of the prostrate
      woman, and bade Domitia hold it. 
 She took the hand in hers; it was stiff and cold as that of a corpse, and she shuddered. 
 “Hold her hand in thine,” said Elymas, “and I will invoke the Source of Spirits, and as I
      withdraw each veil that covers her face, she will see something, and she seeing it, the sense
      of sight will pass through her hand to thee, and thou wilt see also, inwardly, yet very
      really. Only let not go her hand, or all will become dark.” 
 Then he went before the crystal, that stood on an altar like a truncated column; and he
      uttered words rapidly in a strange tongue, then turned, threw a hand
      ful of spices upon the coals, and a dense aromatic smoke filled the interior. It
      dissipated, and Domitia uttered a faint cry.
     
 “What ails thee?” asked Lucius. 
 Thinking she was frightened, he added—“Let us go forth. This is mere jugglery.” 
 “But I see,” she said in tremulous tones. 
 “What dost thou see?” 
 “O Lucius! It is the garden at Cenchræa—and my father! O, my father!” she sobbed. 
 One veil had been withdrawn. 
 “Enough,” said Lucius. “I think naught of this: every one is aware how the noble Cnæus
      Corbulo came by his death.” 
 “Then see again,” said the Magus. He took hold of a second veil that covered the prostrate
      woman, drew it off, and let it fall on the ground. 
 Lucius felt the left hand of Domitia contract suddenly on his arm. He looked before him,
      but saw nothing save the crystal, in which moved lights. It was iridescent as an opal. 
 Then Domitia exclaimed: 
 “It was he! the physician Luke—who cut the thong. But for him, we should have run down the
      Imperial trireme. He did it!” 
 “What mean you?” asked the young man in surprise. 
 “Lucius, I see it all—the sea, the vessel on which is Nero carousing;—ourselves—we are
      running at her. And he has cut the thong, the paddle flies up, and our course is altered.” 
 Then the Magus uttered a few words, and withdrew the third veil. 
 The young man heard his companion breathing heavily; but she said nothing. He waited awhile
      and then, stooping to her, asked: 
 “Seest thou aught?” 
 “Yes,” she answered in a whisper. “Yet not with my bodily eyes, I know not how—but I see—” 
 “What?” 
 “The end of Nero. Now thou hast thrown the mantle over his face—enough!” 
 Then Elymas turned and said: 
 “Hitherto thou hast beheld that which is past. Sufficeth it? or wilt thou even look into
      that which is to be?” 
 “It sufficeth,” said Lucius, and would have drawn his companion away. But she held to the
      hand of the woman on the bed, and said firmly: 
 “No, my friend. Now I have seen things that are past, I will even look into the future. It
      was for this I came hither.” 
 And now again did the magician utter prayers, and wave his hands. Thereupon strange lights
      and changes appeared in the crystal, and it seemed of milky moonlight hue, yet with shoots as
      of lightning traversing it. All at once the Magus took off the fourth veil and cast it on the
      marble floor. 
 Lucius remained motionless, looking at the changing light in the crystal, and feeling the
      nervous hand of Domitia twitching on his arm. He thought that he heard her laugh, but almost
      immediately with a cry, she loosed her hand from the unconscious woman on the couch, threw her
      arms round the neck of Lamia, and sank sobbing on his breast. 
 It was some time before she was sufficiently re
      covered to speak, and then was reluctant to disclose what she had seen. Lucius,
      however, urged her with gentle persuasion, and, clinging to him, between sobs, in whispers she
      confided: 
 “Oh, Lucius! I thought—I—I saw that the day had come when you and I—Lucius, when I went to
      your house and was lifted across the threshold, and then, as I stretched my hands to you and
      took yours—then, all at once, a red face came up behind—whence I know not—and two long hands
      thrust us apart. Then I let go—I let go—and—and I saw no more.” 
 “When that day comes, my Domitia, no hands shall divide us, no face be thrust between. Now
      come forth. You have seen enough.” 
 “Nay, I will look to the end.” She took the hand of Helena, into which some flexibility and
      warmth were returning. 
 “Art thou willing?” asked the Magus. 
 She nodded, and the fifth veil fell. 
 For full five minutes Domitia stood rigid, without moving a muscle, hardly breathing. 
 Then Lucius said: 
 “See what a purple light shines out of the crystal. What is thy vision now, Domitia? By the
      light that beams, it should be right royal.” 
 “It is royal,” she said in faint tones. “Lucius! what that Christian prophet spoke, that
      have I also seen—the beast with seven heads, one wounded to the death, and there cometh up
      another out of the deadly wound, and—it hath the red face I saw but just now. And it climbeth
      to a throne and lifteth me up to sit thereon. Away with the vision. It offendeth me. It maketh
      my blood turn ice cold!” 
 “Hast thou a desire to see further?” asked the Magus. 
 “I can see naught worse than this,” said Domitia. 
 A shudder ran through her, and her teeth chattered as with frost. 
 Then Elymas again waved his hands, and chanted, “Askion, Kataskion, lix, Tetras,
      damnameneus,” and raised and cast down the sixth veil. 
 At once from the crystal a red light shone forth, and suffused the whole cell of the temple
      with a blood-colored illumination, and by it Lucius could see that there was in it no image
      present, only a dense black veil behind the altar on which the stone glowed like a carbuncle.
      He heard the breath pass through the teeth of Domitia, like the hissing of a serpent. He
      looked at her, her face was terrible, inflamed. The eyes stiffened, the teeth were set, the
      brow knitted and lowering. Then she said: 
 “I stand on the beast, and the sword of my father pierces his heart.” 
 Lucius wondered; there was a look of hate, a hideousness in her face, such as he had not
      conceived it possible so beautiful and sweet a countenance could have assumed. 
 Then Elymas cast off the last veil. 
 For a moment all was darkness. The red light in the crystal had expired. In stillness and
      suspense, not without fear, all waited, all standing save Helena, who had recovered from her
      trance, and she paused expectant on her couch. 
 Then a minute spark appeared in the crystal, of the purest white light, that grew, rapidly
      sending out wave on wave of brilliance, so intense, so splendid, so daz
      zling, that the magician, unable to endure the effulgence, turned and threw
      himself into a corner, and wrapped his head about with his mantle. And the medium turned with
      a cry, as though the light caused her physical pain, buried her face in the pillow, and groped
      on the floor for the veils to cast over her head to exclude the light. 
 Lucius, unable to endure the splendor, covered his eyes with his palm. 
 But Domitia looked at it, and her face grew soft, the scowl went from her brow, and a
      wondrous tenderness and sorrow came into her eyes; great tears rose and rolled down her
      cheeks, and glittered like diamonds in the dazzling beam. 
 Then she said with a sob: 
 “Ubi lux—ibi Felicitas.” 
 Suddenly an explosion. The orb was shattered into a thousand sparks, and all was black
      again in the temple—black as deepest night. 
 Then Lucius caught Domitia to him, put his hand behind him, drew back the curtain, and
      carried her forth into the calm evening air, and the light of the aurora hanging over the
      setting sun. 
 She sobbed, gradually recovered herself, drew a profound sigh, and said: 
 “Oh, Lucius! where is light, there is felicity!” 
 “Plancus, come hither!” 
 The lady Longa Duilia was in an easy-chair, and a slave-girl, Lucilla, was engaged in
      driving away the flies that, perhaps attracted by her cosmetics, came towards the lady. 
 Summer was over, and winter storms were beginning to bluster, and the flies were dull with
      cold and only maintained alive by the warmth of the chambers, heated by underground stoves,
      and with pipes to convey the hot air carried through every wall. 
 “Plancus, did you hear me speak?” 
 “I am here, my lady, at your service.” 
 “Really; you have become torpid like the flies. Has the chill made you deaf as well as
      sluggish?” 
 “My lady, I can always hear when you speak.” 
 “Do you mean to imply that I shout like a fishwife?” 
 “I mean not that. But when a harp is played, it sets every thread in every other stringed
      instrument a-chiming; and so is it with me.” 
 “The simile is wiredrawn. What I want you for is—no, I will have no stroking of your face
      like a cat!—is to go to Rome and see that the palace is made ready to receive us. The stoves
      must be well heated, and everything properly aired, The country at best of times is
      tedious; in winter, intolerable. Besides, I have no right to remain here buried.
      I must consider—Plancus, why are you scratching? I must consider my daughter. She is in a fit
      of the blues, and has nothing to say to amuse me. You need not blow like a sea-horse, breathe
      more evenly and equably;—Plancus, you are becoming unendurable. I must not consider my
      bereaved feelings, but her welfare, her health. The air or the situation of Gabii does not
      suit her. Rome is an extraordinarily healthy place in winter. I myself am never better
      anywhere than I am there. I was pretty well at Antioch; there were military there, and I find
      the soil and climate salubrious where there are military. Plancus?—as the Gods love me, you
      have been in the stables. I know it by infallible proofs. Stand at a distance, I insist. And,
      Plancus! you are not showing off conjuring tricks, that you should fold and unfold your hands.
      You go to Rome and take such of the family with you as are necessary. I am not going to be
      mewed up here any longer, because my two years of widowhood are not over. You are making faces
      at me, positively you are, Plancus. Do, I entreat you, look as if you were not a mountebank
      mouthing at a crowd.” 
 “I fly, mistress, as though winged at heel like Mercury.” 
 “Much more like Mercury’s tortoise. Send me Claudius Senecio. I must know what ails
      Domitia. She has the vapors.” 
 “I obey,” said Plancus, 
 “Am I much worn, Lucilla?” asked the lady, as soon as her steward had withdrawn. “The
      laceration of the heart tells on a sensitive nature, and precipitates wrinkles and so on.” 
 “Madam, you bloom as in a second spring.” 
 “A second spring, Lucilla!” exclaimed Longa, sitting bolt upright. “You hussy, how dare
      you? A second spring, indeed! Why, by the zone of Venus, I am not through my first summer
      yet.” 
 “You misconceive me, dear lady. When a virgin has been wedded, then come on her the cares
      of matronhood, the caprices, the ill-humors of her husband—and to some, not without cause, the
      vexation of his jealousy. But when the Gods have removed him, it sometimes happens that the
      ravages caused by the annoyances of marriage disappear, and she reverts to the freshness and
      loveliness of her virginity.” 
 “There is something in what you say; of course it is true only of highly privileged
      natures, in which is some divine blood. A storm ruffles the surface of the lake. When the
      storm is past, the lake resumes its placidity and beauty—exactly as it was before. I have
      noted it a thousand times. Yes, of course it is so. Here comes Senecio; he waddles just like
      the Hindu nurse I saw at Antioch, laboring about with two fat babies.” 
 The Philosopher approached. 
 “I will trouble you to come in front of me,” said the widow. “Have you eaten so heavy a
      meal as to shrink from so much unnecessary exertion? I cannot talk with my neck twisted. The
      windpipe is not naturally constructed like a thread in a rope. I am returning to Rome.” 
 “To Rome, madam! I do not advise that. The place is in commotion. There have been sad
      scenes of riot and pillage in the capital.” 
 “As the Gods love me! what care I so long as they do not invade the house in the Carinæ?” 
 “But there have been also massacres.” 
 “Well, when princes shift about, that is inevitable. They all do it. For my part, I rather
      like—that is, I don’t object to massacres in their proper places and confined to the proper
      persons.” 
 “Madam, you are secure where you are. Why, there was Galba,—he had not been in Rome seven
      months before he was killed, and he did not enter the city save over the bodies of seven
      thousand men, butchered on the Flaminian Way.” 
 “Well! I am not a man. Moreover, I thank the Gods, my house is not on the Flaminian Way,
      nor is it in the Velabrum, nor the Suburra, nor in the Forum Boarium either. We happen to live
      in the Carinæ, and I conceive that there have been no massacres and all that sort of thing
      there.” 
 “No, my dear lady, but when the entire city is disturbed——” 
 “And here, in Gabii, down to the lizards—dead asleep. Give me massacres rather than
      stagnation. I shall get back to Rome before the Ides of December, on account of my daughter’s
      health. By the way, will you believe it? She gave away the sword of my dear Corbulo to Lucius
      Lamia. Just conceive!—how effective that sword would be in my house—in the tablinum, the
      atrium, anywhere—and how I could point to it, and my feelings!—I can imagine nothing more
      striking. I have told Lamia to restore it. I would not lose it for a great deal. Well now,
      come. Any news from the capital?” 
 “Madam, you are aware that Galba fell, and that Otho threw himself on his sword after a
      reign of ninety days; and now the new Cæsar Vitellius is men
      aced. I hear that the East has risen, and that Vespasian has been proclaimed in
      Syria. The legions in Illyria have also declared for him and are marching into Italy. Egypt
      has pronounced against Vitellius, and it is but seven months since Otho died by his own hand.” 
 “Vespasian, did you say?” exclaimed the lady. “My good Senecio, he is a sort of cousin, a
      country cousin, just one of those cousins that can be cultivated into kinship, or dropped out
      of relationship as circumstances decide. His father was a pottering sort of a man, an
      auctioneer, and commissioner of drains and dirt and all that sort of thing. A worthy fellow, I
      dare say; I believe he had a statue erected to him somewhere because he did the scavengering
      so well. He married above his position, one Vespasia Polla; I have seen and heard of her, a
      round-faced woman like a pudding; he took her for her blood, but she was only a knight’s
      daughter; and those city knights, as the Gods love me! what a money-grubbing low set they are!
      His son, Flavius Vespasianus is proclaimed! It is really funny. It is, O Morals! I must laugh.
      Now, if my good man had but listened to me. But there, I shall become mad.—I don’t know how
      long it is since you have been pecking, or whether you eat all day long? But you have crumbs
      sticking in your beard. Another time be good enough to comb your beard before approaching me.
      Tell me, what has given Domitia the dumps?” 
 “I believe, madam, she has been frightened by that unscrupulous impostor, Elymas, or
      Ascleparion, or whatever he is called. I do not know particulars, but believe that he
      pretended to show her the future.” 
 “The future! Delicious! And what did she see?” 
 “That I cannot say, but she has looked wan ever since, neither smiles nor speaks, but sits,
      when the sun shines, on the balustrade above the water, looking into it, as in a dream. I hear
      that she holds converse with none, save her maid, Euphrosyne.” 
 “I wonder what she has seen! Anything concerning me?” 
 “Madam, that braggart and intriguer is made up of lies. He has frightened her with
      pretended predictions. If I might advise, I would counsel his expulsion from the house.” 
 “I should like to hear what are the chances for Flavius Vespasian. I think I shall inquire
      myself. I knew Vespasian once, of course he is vastly my senior. If he be successful, he may
      get a proconsulship for our Lamia. He! Flavius Vespasian a Cæsar! There is push for you! As
      the Gods love me, there is nothing like push. I must go to Rome. Positively two years
      retirement for a widow is unreasonable. In the good old days of the Republic one was thought
      enough. I would not have the Republic back for anything else, though of course we all talk
      about Liberty and Cato, and all that sort of thing—it is talk—nothing else. I must go to Rome.
      Flavius Sabinus is præfect of the city, and he is the elder brother of Vespasian. I might show
      him some little inconspicuous civilities—give a little cosy, quiet supper. By the way—yes, he
      is married to an old hunks, I remember. Oh! if his brother gets to the top, he can divorce
      her. Yes, positively I shall not be able to breathe till I get back to Rome. By the way, draw
      me up on a couple of tablets some moral philosophizing suitable to widowhood, pepper it well
      with lines from lyric poets. I will learn it all by
      heart in my litter, and serve out as occasion offers. I positively must be home
      before the Ides; why—” with a start of pleasure—“The Ides of December! that is the dedication
      feast of the temple of Tellus in the Carinæ. There you have it! Devotion to the gods—an excuse
      for a little supper—a wee little supper—but so good and so nicely turned out.” 
 Longa Duilia and her entire household had returned to the capital, and were installed in
      the family mansion in the Carinæ. 
 Happily, as Corbulo had considered it, this house had escaped in the conflagration of Rome
      under Nero. This, however, was a matter of some regret to Duilia, who would have preferred to
      have had it burnt, so that it might have been rebuilt in greater splendor and in newer style. 
 Nevertheless, although externally dingy, it was a commodious mansion within, and was well
      furnished, especially with carpets and curtains of Oriental texture, that had been wrought at,
      or purchased at the bazaars of Antioch and Damascus. 
 The centre of the house was occupied by the atrium, or hall, open to the
      sky above the water tank in the midst. On each side at the further end from the entrance
      extended the “wings” that contained the family portraits enclosed in gilded boxes or shrines,
      the doors of which were thrown open on festal occasions. In the centre, between the wings was
      the tablinum, the reception-room of the house, and on the right side of the
      entrance was the family money-chest, girded with iron. 
 On the ledge of the water tank before the reception room, smoked a little altar before an
      image of Larpater, the ancestor and founder of the family, regarded as the tutelary deity of
      the house. 
 The penates, the subsidiary household gods, that had formerly been
      retained in the hall, near the altar—curious, smoked, and badly-shaped dolls, some in rags,
      some in wood, others in terra cotta—were sometimes consigned to a family chapel, but in the
      house of the widow of Corbulo, as in many another, they had been relegated to a shelf in the
      kitchen near the hearth, and a lamp was maintained perpetually burning before them. 
 In primitive times, when life was simple, the hall had been the common room of the house,
      in which the wife cooked the meals at the hearth, and where also on seats, father, wife,
      children and domestics partook together of the common meal. But now all this was altered. 
 In winter the hall was too cold to be sat in. It was inconvenient to have the cooking done
      before all eyes. Consequently a separate kitchen and separate dining-rooms were constructed,
      and the smoking altar and the image by it alone remained in the hall as a reminiscence of the
      family hearth that once stood there. 
 It is more difficult to understand the meals and meal times of the old Romans, than the
      arrangement of their houses. 
 They rose vastly early in the morning, and took a snack of breakfast of the simplest
      description, which lasted them till lunch at 10 a. m. But such as were occupied abroad rarely
      returned home for this meal. At noon they bathed, and then came the great feed of
      the day, the cœna, which we translate “supper,” but which was
      begun at half-past one in winter and an hour later in summer. 
 This lasted the entire afternoon, and even on great occasions into the night. Some
      revellers did not break up till midnight, or even prolonged the orgy to dawn. 
 It was not till the Goths and Vandals overflowed the classic world, that the supper was
      postponed until the evening. 
 The Roman citizen’s day was from dawn till noon. Then he had his snooze and his bath, and
      the remainder of the day was devoted to the mighty meal and to reading, conversation, and
      amusement. 
 “I am so pleased to see you,” said Longa Duilia, stepping forward to receive the Præfect of
      Rome, to her little supper. 
 He was a gray-headed, plain, blunt man, with very ordinary features; he was attended by two
      lictors, and by his son, Sabinus. 
 “I thank you, madam, for the courteous invitation.” 
 “I could kill myself with vexation not to have made your acquaintance earlier. You see, for
      some years I have been at Antioch, with my dearest husband, whose sword—that sword which drank
      the blood of Germans, Parthians and Armenians—excuse these tears—you see it—suspended yonder.
      But, as I was saying, we have been from Rome so long, and since my return I have lived in such
      seclusion, that we have not met—and yet, considering our relationship——” 
 “My dear lady, I was unaware that I was entitled to such an honor.” 
 “Oh! yes, of course, cousins.” 
 “Cousins!” 
 “Through Vespasia Polla, your mother. What a sweet creature she was! So distinguished in
      her manner. She had such an intelligent face, and, as I remember her, the remains of great
      beauty. Of course I was then quite a mite of a child.” 
 “This is indeed flattering.” 
 “You men have other things to consider beside pedigree. Cousins we certainly are. And how
      is that sweet lady, your wife? By all accounts as frail as the last autumn leaf on an
       acacia.” 
 “I am glad to say that, on the contrary, she enjoys rude health.” 
 “You do not say so! What fibs are told! Your son Clemens is not here? I—I have heard, does
      not go into society, a little peculiar in his views. We are not all made alike. But this, your
      son Sabinus, is formed like an Apollo. And your daughter Plautilla—so sorry! infected in the
      same way. Will not go to dinners or shows—ah! well it is her loss. It is a pleasure to reunite
      family ties. Alas! you know of my irreparable loss. I do not know whether you saw the sword of
      my darling. He fell on it. Bathed it with his blood. Every night I bedew the sacred blade with
      my tears. Excuse me—my emotion overcomes me. I would have buried myself at Gabii, clasping the
      sword to my wounded bosom for the remainder of my shattered life, had it not been for the
      health of my child. A mother’s thoughts are with her offspring. Well, now to
       table. A widow’s fare, only a small supper in a house of mourning—though more
      than a twelvemonth since the funeral—indeed, two years since my dear one died—on that sword.
      Oh! I turn away my eyes! The sight of that blade. But,
      come—that is my daughter. Salute her. A cousin. Give me your hand, Flavius. The
      table calls us.” 
 The house of a wealthy Roman at this period had not only a summer dining-room, open to the
      air, but one also for winter, well heated by stoves. Three tables were placed, so as to
      accommodate nine persons, three at each, leaving the ends of two and an open square in the
      middle. 
 Into this hollow the servants ran the “repository,” a sort of what-not, on wheels,
      consisting of a tier of shelves, all laden with dishes; and the guests put forth their hands
      and selected such meats as they fancied. 
 Knives they had, but no forks. In place of these latter they were furnished with spoons,
      having the extremity of the handle turned down as claw or hoof, or sharpened to a point, so as
      to serve to hold the meat whilst it was being cut. When so employed, the bowl of the spoon was
      held in the hollow of the hand; but when used as a spoon, then the end was reversed. 
 A sideboard was piled up with silver and gold plate. In addition in a corner stood a round
      table with three feet; on which were laid napkins neatly tied up with blue and red bands.
      These napkins contained trinkets, rings, brooches, comfits, mottoes, and were to be given to
      the guests along with the dessert. Our presentation of Christmas crackers is a reminiscence of
      the old Roman custom of making presents to the guests at the close of a banquet. 
 The males lay at table on couches, with their legs extended behind them, their left elbows
      reposed on pillows. It was against ancient Roman custom for ladies to recline, but recently
      some empresses had
      broken through the rule, and when they set the example of lounging, others
      followed. Duilia, however, was a stickler in some things, and she somewhat affected archaic
      usages, as a mark of distinction, as a token of the antiquity of the family, whose customs had
      acquired an almost sacred sanction. Ladies sat on stools. 
 The couches and seats were sumptuous, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, tortoise-shell and
      silver, and were covered with Oriental carpets. 
 Every guest was attended by a slave, bearing an ewer and napkin, so that he might cleanse
      his fingers directly they became greasy—a necessity of constant recurrence, on account of the
      absence of proper forks. 
 A baldachin of embroidered silk was stretched above the table, and the heads of the
      banqueters. This was done for the purpose of cutting off the draught, as immediately above, in
      the ceiling, was the lacunar, an opening through which the steam and savor
      of dinner might escape, and through which, when the canopy was not spread, rose-leaves,
      violets, a spray of scent, even garlands were scattered over the revellers. 
 A Roman dinner began, like one in Russia at the present day, with a
       gustus, a snack of something calculated to stimulate the appetite or to
      help digestion. 
 Then came in soft-boiled eggs, the invariable first dish, just as invariably, the meal
      closed with apples. 
 With the eggs were served salads and sauer-kraut, cabbage shredded in vinegar, Brussels
      sprouts boiled with saltpetre to enhance their green, turnips and carrots in mustard and
      vinegar. Melons were eaten with pepper, salt, and vinegar; artichokes were consumed raw, with
      oil; mallows and sorrel, olives, mush
      rooms and truffles were favorite vegetables, and were eaten along with large
      snails, oysters, sardines, and chopped lizards. 
 All this was preparatory. 
 Now entered the repository, groaning under meats and fish. At the same moment a slave
      produced and handed round a menu card. But before eating, a benediction was pronounced, the
      household gods were invoked and promised a share of the good things from the table. 
 It is unnecessary to catalogue the solids and entrées sent up at such a
      supper. Pork was a favorite dish, and there were fifty ways in which a pig could be served up.
      Octopus was much relished, as it is to this day in Italy. Wild fowl was stuffed with garlic,
      mutton with asafœtida, and some meats were not considered in condition till decomposition had
      begun. 
 The strong savor produced by those dishes was dissipated by servants holding large fans,
      and counteracted by the diffusion of aromatic smoke, and the sprinkling of guests and table
      with essences. 
 A supper consisted of several courses, but a considerable interval elapsed between each,
      which interval was filled in with conversation, or enlivened with the antics of buffoons, or
      with music, or the recitation of poetry. 
 Nothing in the smallest degree unseemly was allowed in the house of Longa Duilia, at such
      entertainments. 
 We read a good deal, in the ancient authors, of the license allowed at such times, but this
      was not general, certainly was not suffered except in very “fast” houses, and such were
      attended by none who respected themselves. 
 The widow knew how to make herself agreeable. Flavius Sabinus, the præfect, was a great
      talker, and there was a little rivalry between the two as to which should lead the
      conversation. Domitia hardly spoke, but the guests generally entertained themselves heartily. 
 Lamia was there, and near his betrothed, but found it difficult to carry on conversation
      with her. Since the questioning of Ishtar in the Temple at Gabii, she had been haunted by the
      visions presented to her inner sight, and she was unable to shake off the oppression of
      spirits and distress of mind, they had caused. 
 When supper was ended, previous to the dessert, all rose, a grace was said, and again the
      household gods were invoked. 
 All were thus standing, in solemn hush, whilst a portion for the deities was being taken
      away, when the curtain before the door was roughly drawn aside, and a young man ran in—then
      halted, bewildered by the lights and the company, and hesitated before advancing further. 
 A faint cry escaped the breast of Domitia; and she staggered back, and caught Lamia
      convulsively by the wrist. 
 Then Flavius Sabinus said apologetically to his hostess: 
 “This youth is my nephew, Titus Flavius Domitianus, the younger son of my brother
      Vespasian. Pardon his lack of breeding, lady—I bade him find me here, if matters of importance
      demanded my attention. Excuse me, I pray, if I retire with him and hear what news of weight he
      bears.” 
 Duilia bowed, and the præfect, leaving his place, went to meet his nephew. 
 Lamia felt that Domitia was trembling. He looked in her face and it alarmed him. With wide
      eyes she was staring at the intruder; her lips were slightly parted, every trace of color had
      deserted them; and between them gleamed her teeth. 
 Not till the curtain had fallen, and hidden the form of the young man, as he left with his
      uncle, did she breathe freer. 
 Then she heaved a long sigh, and said in a faint voice: 
 “It is he—the eighth crowned head—the fifth come again—the new Nero. O Lamia! Terrible is
      Fate!” 
 “My dear child,” said Duilia, “I never did a better stroke of policy than that supper a few
      evenings ago. It went off quite charmingly, without a hitch. I allowed that good Flavius
      Sabinus to talk; and he is just one of those men who enjoys himself best where he is given
      full flow for his twaddle. A good, worthy, commonplace man. I doubt if he has push in him, but
      he is just so situated now that he must go ahead. The news is most encouraging. Mucianus is on
      his way to Italy at the head of an army. Primus, with his legions, is approaching; he has
      beaten the troops sent against him, and has sacked Cremona; there are positively none who hold
      by Vitellius except his brother in Campania, and his German bodyguard. Domitia,” the widow
      dropped her voice, “we can do better than with that milksop Ælius Lamia.” 
 “Mother, I will have no other.” 
 “Then we must push him up into position. But come, my dear, we must show ourselves at the
      Lectisternia. It will be expected of us, and be setting a good example, and all that sort of
      thing, and it is positively wicked to mope indoors when we ought to be seen in the streets and
      the forum. So there, make yourself ready. I am going instantly. I have ordered round
      the palanquins, and, as you may perceive, I am dressed and my hair done to go
      out. That supper was quite a success.” 
 The time was now that of the Saturnalia, lasting seven days, beginning on the 17th December
      with a strange institution, a banquet of the gods. Usually the several gods had their feasts
      in their own temples and invited others to them, but on certain solemn occasions all banqueted
      together in public. The distress, the butcheries, the general confusion caused by the setting
      up and casting down of emperors—three in ten months—and now, eight months after, a fourth
      tottering; and every change involving massacre, plunder, disturbance of order;—this had moved
      the priests to decree a solemn lectisternium and supplication for the restoration of
      tranquillity and the cessation of civil broil. 
 The banquet was to take place in the forum. 
 “You shall come in the lectica (palanquin) with me,” said Duilia. “It
      will have quite a pathetic aspect—the widow and the orphan together. Besides, I want some one
      to talk to. What do you think of Flavius Domitianus? A modest lad, to my mind.” 
 “Shy and clumsy,” observed Domitia. “The sight of him is a horror to me.” 
 “My dear child, only a fool will take sprats when he can have whitebait. Look out to better
      yourself.” 
 “Oh, mother!—what is that?” 
 “A god going to supper,” said the lady. “We shall see plenty of them presently.” 
 That which had attracted her daughter’s attention was a bier supported on the shoulders of
      priests, on which lay a figure dressed handsomely, in the attitude
      of a man at table, raised on his left elbow that was buried in a pillow, the head
      erect and the right arm extended, balanced in the air. The body was probably of wood under the
      drooping drapery, but the face and hands and feet were of wax. In jolting over the pavement,
      the sleeve had become disarranged, and showed the wooden prop that sustained the waxen right
      hand. The face was colored, the eyes were of glass, and real hair was affixed to the head; the
      lower jaw, hung on wires, opened and shut with the jostling. The staring figure swaying on the
      shoulders of the bearers, had a sufficiently startling effect, sweeping round a corner,
      wagging its beard, and past the palanquin in which were the ladies. 
 “A thing like that can’t eat,” said Domitia. 
 “Oh, my dear child, no. The gods only sniff at the food. After it has been set before them,
      it is carried away, and the people scramble for it.” 
 “They are naught but wax and woodwork,” said the girl contemptuously. 
 “My child, how often have I not had to quote to you that text, “It is not well to be
      overwise about the gods?” Here we are! What a crowd!” 
 The forum of Rome, that wondrous basin towered over on one side by the Capitol, inclosed on
      another by the Palatine, and on the third by the densely packed blocks of houses in the
      Suburra below the Quirinal, Viminal and Esquiline Hills, was itself crowded with temples and
      basilicas, yet not then as dense with monuments as later, when the open spaces were further
      encroached upon by the Antonines. 
 “Domitia,” said Longa Duilia, in her ear, “all things are working out excellently.
      Vitellius is aware
      that he has no chance, and has been consulting with our cousin in the Temple of
      Concord yonder, and they have nearly settled between them that Vespasian is to assume the
      purple without further opposition. Vitellius will retire to some country villa on a handsome
      annuity. That will prevent more bloodshed and confiscation, and all that sort of thing. It is
      always advisable to avoid unpleasantnesses if possible. There, child, there are quite a bevy
      of gods already at table. See that dear old doll, Summanus, without a head—you know it was
      struck off by lightning in the time of Pyrrhus. It was of clay, and rolled all the way to the
      Tiber and plopped in. Since then he has been without a head, the darling!” 
 “How can he either smell or eat, mother?” 
 “My child, I don’t ask. It is not well to be overwise about the gods. There go the Arval
      Brothers with the image of Aca Larentia seated—of course not lying. You will see some
      venerable curiosities, who put in an appearance on days like this so as not to be wholly
      forgotten.” 
 The sight presented by the forum was indeed strange. A space had been cleared and shut off
      from the intrusion of the crowd, and there lay and sat the images at tables that were spread
      with viands. All were either life-size or larger. Some were skilfully modelled, and wore
      gorgeous clothing, but others were of the rudest moulding in terra cotta, or carved wood, and
      evidently of very ancient date, of Etruscan workmanship little influenced by Greek art. 
 Domitia looked on in astonishment. The populace laughed and commented on the images,
      without the least reverence; and the priests and their assistants
      laid the dishes before the puppets, then whisked them off and carried them
      without the barriers. Thereupon ensued a struggle who should get hold of the savory morsels
      that were being conveyed from the table of the gods; even the vessels used for the viands and
      for the wine were snatched at and carried away, and the priests offered no resistance. 
 Domitia was completely transported out of herself by astonishment at the sight. Every now
      and then the hum of voices spluttered into a burst of laughter at some ribald joke, and then
      roared up into a hubbub of sound over the trays of meats and wine that were being fought for. 
 Already the short winter day was closing in, and torches were being brought forth and stood
      beside the images. Then the tables were cleared and removed. 
 A trumpet blast sounded, and instantly the barriers were cast down, and the second act of
      this extraordinary spectacle ensued. This was the supplication. Instantly the temper of the
      mob changed from scepticism and mockery to enthusiastic devotion, and those pressed forward to
      kneel and touch the cushions and drapery on which the gods reposed, and to entreat their
      assistance, whose lips had but recently uttered a scoff. 
 Nothing so completely differentiates Christian worship from that of Pagan Rome as the
      congregational character of the former contrasted with the uncongregational nature of the
      latter. At the present day in Papal Rome the priests may be seen behind glass doors in little
      chapels annexed to S. Peter’s and S. Maria Maggiore saying their offices,
      indifferent to there being no laity present, indeed, with no provision made that
      they should assist. This is a legacy of Pagan Rome. The sacrifices, the services in the
      temples and other sanctuaries, were entirely independent of the people, some performed within
      closed doors. The only popular religious service was the supplication,
      which took place but occasionally. Then the public streamed to the images of the gods,
      uttering fervent prayer, chanting hymns, prostrating themselves before the couches, catching
      at their bed-coverings, esteeming themselves blessed if they could lay their hands on the
      sacred pillows. But there was no general consent as to which of the gods and goddesses were
      most potent. Some cried out that Mother Orbona had helped them, others that Fortuna was a jade
      and promised but performed nothing. One fanatic, in a transport, shrieked that these gods were
      good for naught, for his part he trusted only in Consus, whose temple was in ruins, whose
      altar was buried in earth by the circus of Tarquin. But there were others who swept in a
      strong current towards the couch of Jupiter and of that of Venus. Another strong current,
      howling ‘Io Saturne! Salve Mater Ops!’ made for the images of the Old God of Time and his
      divine Mate. 
 Simultaneously came a cross current of vendors of cakes and toys from the Suburra,
      regardless of the devotion of the people, careful only to sell their goods—for the Saturnalia
      was a period at which the children were regaled with gingerbread, and treated to dolls of
      terra cotta, of ivory and of wood. Hawkers selling pistachio nuts, the cones of the edible
      pine, men with baked chestnuts, others with trays of Pomponian pears
      and Mattian apples, vociferating and belauding their wares, increased the clamor. 
 Whilst this was at its height, down from the Palatine by the New Way came the German
      Imperial Body-Guard, forcing a passage through the mob, their short swords drawn, bellowing
      imprecations, whirling their blades, striking with the flat of the steel, threatening to cut
      down such as impeded their progress. 
 Some vigiles, or city police, came up. There was no love lost between
      them and the pampered foreigners employed in the palace, and they opposed the household
      troops. Remonstrances were employed and cast away. Then a German was struck in the face by a
      pine cone, another tripped, fell, and a hawker with a barrow-load of dolls, in his eagerness
      to escape, ran his vehicle over the prostrate guardsman. At once the Germans’ blood was up,
      they rushed upon the police, and a fray ensued in which now this side, then that, gained
      advantage. The populace, densely packed, came in for blows and wounds. When a guardsman fell,
      and they could lay hold of him, he was dragged away, and almost torn to pieces by eager hands
      stripping him of his splendid uniform. 
 The Præfect, who was in the Forum, summoned three cohorts to his aid, to drive back the
      household troops, and in a moment the trough between the hills was converted into a scene of
      the wildest confusion, some women screaming that they had lost their children, others crying
      to the gods to help them. Boys had scrambled up the bases of the statues, and one urchin sat
      with folded legs on the shoulders of Julius Cæsar, hallooing, and occasionally pelting with
      nuts where they did not fear retaliation. 
 The vendors of cakes and toys cursed as their trays were upset, or their barrows clashed.
      Men fought each other, for no other reason than that the soldiers were engaged, and they were
      unable to keep their itching hands off each other. 
 Down a stair from the palace came the Emperor Vitellius, carried on the shoulders of
      soldiers, while slaves bore flambeaux before him. 
 He was seen to gesticulate, but in the uproar none heard what he said. 
 Meanwhile, the priests were endeavoring to remove the gods, and met with the greatest
      difficulty. Some frantic women clung to the images and refused to allow them to be taken away.
      Some of the figures had been upset, and the servants of the temples to which they belonged
      made rings about them with interlaced arms, to protect them from being trampled under foot.
      Jupiter Capitolinus had been injured and lost his nose. 
 A priest with the help of a torch, was melting the wax and fastening it on again, whilst
      the guard of the temple kept off the rabble. 
 The currents of human beings, driven by diverse passions, jostled, broke across each other,
      resolved themselves into swirls of living men and women carried off their feet. 
 The litter of the lady Duilia and her daughter tossed like a boat in a whirlpool, and the
      widow shrieked with terror. 
 Then two powerful arms were thrust within the curtains of the palanquin, and the slave
      Eboracus laid hold of Domitia, and said:— 
 “There is no safety here. Trust me. I will battle through with you. Come on my arm. Fear
      not.” 
 “Save me! Me, also!” screamed Duilia, “I shall be thrown out, trodden under
      foot! O my wig! My wig!” 
 But Eboracus, regardless of the widow, holding his young mistress on his left arm, with the
      right armed with a cudgel, which he whirled like a flail, and with which, without compunction
      he broke down all opposition, drove, battered his way through the throng where most dense,
      across the currents most violent, and did not stay till he had reached a comparatively
      unobstructed spot, in one of the narrow lanes between the Fish Market and the Hostilian Court. 
 Hardly had Eboracus conveyed Domitia out of the Forum into a place of safety, than a rush
      of people down the street threatened to drive him back in the direction whence he had come.
      The drifting mob, as it cascaded down, cried: “The Prætorians are coming from their camp!” 
 It was so. Down the hill by the Tiburtine way marched a compact body of soldiery. 
 The danger was imminent; Eboracus and his young charge were between two masses of military,
      entangled in a seething mob of frightened people, mostly of the lowest class. 
 “My lady!” said the slave. “There is but one thing to be done.” 
 He drew her to a door, knocked, and when a voice asked who demanded admittance, answered, 
 “Open speedily—Paris!” 
 The door was furtively unbarred and opened sufficiently to admit the slave and Domitia, and
      then hastily bolted and locked again. 
 “Excuse me, dear mistress,” said Eboracus. “I could do no other. In this
       insula live the actor Paris and Glyceria. They were both slaves in your
      household, but were given their freedom by your father, my
      late master, when he went to the East. They will place themselves at your
      service, and offer you shelter in their humble dwelling, the first flat on the right.” 
 The house was one of those insulæ, islets of Rome in which great numbers
      of the lower classes were housed. They consisted in square blocks, built about a court, and
      ran to the height of seven and even more stories. The several flats were reached by stone
      stairs that ran from the central yard to the very summit of these barrack-like buildings. They
      vastly resembled our modern model lodging-houses, with one exception, that they had no
      exterior windows, or at most only slits looking into the street; doors and windows opened into
      the central quadrangle. These houses were little towns, occupied by numerous families, each
      family renting two or more chambers on a flat, and as in a city there are diversities in rank,
      so was it in these lodging-houses; the most abjectly poor were at the very top, or on the
      ground floor. The first flat commanded the highest rent, and the price of rooms gradually
      dwindled, the greater the elevation was. Glass was too great a luxury, far too costly to be
      employed except by the most wealthy for filling their windows. Even talc was expensive; in its
      place thin films of agate were sometimes used; but among the poor there was little protection
      in their dwellings against cold. The doors admitted light and air and cold together, and were
      always open, except at night, and then a perforation in the wood, or a small window in the
      wall, too narrow to allow of ingress, served for ventilation. 
 In a huge block of building like the insula, there were no chimneys. All
      cooking was done at the
      hearth in the room that served as kitchen and dining-room, often also as bedroom,
      and the smoke found its way out at the doorway into the central court. 
 But, in fact, little cooking of food was done, except the boiling of pulse. The meals of
      the poor consisted mainly of salads and fruit, with oil in abundance. 
 Dressed always in wool, in cold weather multiplying their wraps, the Roman citizens felt
      the cold weather much less than we might suppose possible. In the rain—and in Rome in winter
      it raineth almost every day—the balconies were crowded, and then the women wove, men tinkered
      or patched sandals, children romped, boys played marbles and knuckle-bones, and sometimes a
      minstrel twanged a lyre and the young girls danced to keep themselves warm. There were little
      braziers, moreover, one on every landing, that were kept alight with charcoal, and here, when
      the women’s fingers were numb, they were thawed, and children baked chestnuts or roasted
      apples. 
 Domitia had never been in one of these blocks of habitations of the lower classes before,
      and she was surprised. The quadrangle was almost like an amphitheatre, with its tiers of seats
      for spectators; but here, in place of seats, were balconies, and every balcony was alive with
      women and children. Men were absent; they had gone out to see the commencement of the
      Saturnalia, and of women there were few compared to the numbers that usually thronged these
      balconies. 
 Eboracus conducted his young mistress up the first flight of steps, and at once a rush of
      children was made to him to ask for toys and cakes. He brushed them aside, and when the
      mothers saw by the purple edge to her dress that Domitia belonged to a noble family,
      they called their youngsters away, and saluted her by raising thumb and
      forefinger united to the lips. 
 The slave at once conducted Domitia through a doorway into a little chamber, where burnt a
      fire of olive sticks, and a lamp was suspended, by the light of which she could see that a
      sick woman lay on a low bed. 
 Domitia shrank back; but Eboracus said encouragingly: 
 “Be not afraid, dear young mistress; this is no catching disorder; Glyceria suffers from an
      accident, and will never be well again. She is the sister of your servant Euphrosyne.” 
 Then, approaching the sick woman, he hastily explained the reason for his taking refuge
      with his mistress in this humble lodging. 
 The sick woman turned to Domitia with a sweet smile, and in courteous words entreated her
      to remain in her chamber so long as was necessary. 
 “My husband, Paris, the actor, is now out; but he will be home shortly, I trust—unless,”
      her face grew paler with sudden dread, “some ill have befallen him. Yet I think not that can
      be, he is a quiet, harmless man.” 
 “I thank you,” answered Domitia, and took a seat offered her by Eboracus. 
 She looked attentively at the sick woman’s face. She was no longer young, she had at one
      time been beautiful, she had large, lustrous dark eyes, and dark hair, but pain and weakness
      had sharpened her features. Yet there was such gentleness, patience, love in her face, a
      something which to Domitia was so new, a something so new in that old world, that she could
      not
      take her eyes off her, wondering what the fascination was. 
 Glyceria did not speak again, modestly waiting till the lady of rank chose to address her. 
 Presently Domitia asked: 
 “Have you been long ill?” 
 “A year, lady.” 
 “And may I inquire how it came about?” 
 “Alas! It is a sad story. My little boy——” 
 “You have a son?” 
 “I had——” 
 “I ask your pardon for the interruption; say on.” 
 “My little boy was playing in the street, when a chariot was driven rapidly down the hill,
      and I saw that he would be under the horses’ feet, so I made a dart to save him.” 
 “And then?” 
 “I was too late to rescue him, and I fell, and the wheel went over me. I have been unable
      to rise since.” 
 “What! like this for all these months! What say the doctors?” 
 “Alack, lady! they give me no hope.” 
 “But for how long may this last?” 
 “I cannot say.” 
 “As the gods love me! if this befell me, I should refuse my food and starve myself to
      death!” 
 “I cannot do that.” 
 “What! you lack the resolution?” 
 “I can bear what is on me laid by God.” 
 “There is no need to endure what can be avoided. I would make short work of it, were this
      my lot. And your husband?” 
 “He is here.” 
 Through the door came the actor, a handsome man, of Greek type, with a package in his arms.
      He would have walked straight to his wife, but had to turn at the door and drive off a
      clamorous pack of urchins who had pursued him, believing that he was laden with toys. 
 “There, Glyceria!” he exclaimed joyously; “they are all for you. There is such a riot and
      disturbance and such a crush in the street, that I had hard work to push through. I misdoubt
      me some are broken.” 
 “Oh, Paris! do you not observe?” 
 “What? I see nothing but thy sweet face?” 
 “Our dear master’s daughter, the lady Domitia Longina.” 
 The actor turned sharply, and was covered with confusion at the unexpected sight, and
      almost let his parcel fall. 
 Eboracus explained the circumstances. Then Paris expressed his happiness, and the pride he
      felt in being honored by the visit under his humble ceiling, of the lady, the daughter of the
      good and beloved master who had given him and Glyceria their freedom. 
 “Go forth, Eboracus,” said Domitia, “and I prithee learn how it has fared with my mother.
      Bring me word speedily, if thou canst.” 
 When the slave had withdrawn, she addressed Paris and Glyceria. 
 “I beseech you, suffer me to remain here in quiet, and concern not yourselves about me. I
      have been alarmed, and this has shaken me. I would fain rest in this seat and not speak. Go on
      with what ye have to say and do, and consider me not. So will you best please me.” 
 The actor was somewhat constrained at first, but after a little while overcame his reserve.
      He drew a low table beside his wife’s couch, and, stooping on one knee, began to unlade his
      bundle. He set out a number of terra cotta figures on the table, representing cocks and hens,
      pigs, horses, cows and men; some infinitely comical; at them Glyceria laughed. 
 Then, as she put forth a thin white hand to take up one of the quaintest images, Domitia
      noticed that Paris laid hold of it, and pressed it to his lips. 
 A lump rose in the girl’s throat. 
 “No,” thought she; “if I had one so to love me and consider me, though I were sick and in
      pain, I would not shorten my days. I would live to enjoy his love.” 
 Then again, falling into further musing, she said to herself: 
 “In time to come, if it chance that I become ill, will my Lamia be to me as is this actor
      to his poor wife? Will he think of and care for me? But—and if evil were to befall him, would
      not I minister to him, care for him night and day, and seek to relieve his sorrow? Would I
      grow indifferent when he most needed me? Then why think that he should become cold and neglect
      me? Are women more inclined to be true than men?—Yet see this actor—this Paris. By the Gods!
      Is Lamia like to be a more ignoble man than a poor freedman that gains his living on the
      stage?—I should even be happy serving him sick and suffering. Happy in doing my duty.” 
 And still musing, she said on to herself: 
 “Duty! Yes, I should find content and rest of mind in that; but to what would it all lead?
      Only to a heap of dust in the end. His light would be extinguished,
      and then I, having nothing else to live for, would die also—by mine own
      hand:—there is nothing beyond. It all leads to an ash-heap.” 
 Glyceria, observing the girl’s fixed eye, thought it was looking inquiringly at her, and
      said in her gentle voice that vibrated with the tremulousness given by suffering: 
 “Ah, lady! the neighbors and their children are very kind. There is more of goodness and
      piety in the world than you would suppose, seeing men and women only in an amphitheatre. I can
      do but very little. One boy fetches me water—that is Bibulus, and my Paris has bought him this
      little horseman—and Torquata, a little girl, daughter of a cobbler, she sweeps the floor; and
      Dosithea, that is a good widow’s child; she does other neighborly acts for me;—and they thrust
      me on my bed to the side of the hearth, and bring me such things as I need, that I may prepare
      the meals for my husband. And Claudia, the wife of a seller of nets, she makes my bed for me;
      but all the shopping is done for me by Paris, and I warrant you, lady, he is quite knowing,
      and can haggle over a fish or a turnip with a market-woman like any housewife.” 
 “He is very good to you,” said Domitia. 
 Then Paris turned, and, putting his hand on his wife’s mouth, said: 
 “Lady! you can little know what a wife my Glyceria is to me. I had rather for my own sake
      have her thus than hale as of old. Somehow, sorrow and pain draw hearts together wondrously.” 
 “He is good,” said Glyceria, twisting her mouth from his covering hand. “We have had a hard
      year; on
      account of the troubles, there has been little desire among the people for the
      theatre, and he has earned but a trifle. I have cost him much in physicians that have done me
      no good, yet he never grumbles, he is always cheerful, always tender-hearted and loving.” 
 “Hush, wife!” said Paris. “The lady desires rest. Keep silence.” 
 Then again Domitia fell a-musing, and the player and his wife whispered to each other about
      the destination of the several toys. 
 Somehow she had hitherto not thought of the classes of men and women below her station as
      having like feelings, like longings, like natures to her own. They had been to her as puppets,
      even as those clay figures ranged on the table, mostly grotesque. Now that great pulse of love
      that throbs through the world of humanity made itself felt, it was as though scales fell from
      her eyes, and the puppets became beings of flesh and blood to be considered, capable of
      happiness and of suffering, of virtue as well as of vice. 
 “I have a little lamp here—with a fish—the fish on it,” said Paris in a whisper.
      “It is for Luke, the Physician.” 
 “What!” exclaimed Domitia, starting from her reverie, “you know him? We had a talk once,
      and it was broken off and never concluded. I would hear the end of what he was saying—some
      day.” 
 Eboracus brushed aside some urchins and girls blocking the door, looking in with eager,
      twinkling eyes at the strange lady and at the set out of dolls on the table. 
 There passed whispers and nudges from one to another—but all ceased as the British slave
      put together his hands as a swimmer and plunged through them. 
 “Get away you sprats and gudgeons,” said he, good-humoredly. 
 Then entering, he said to Domitia: 
 “Lady, your mother has reached home in safety. I chanced to run across Amphibolus, sent out
      in quest of you, and the good-for-naught had turned sulky, because it is the Saturnalia, when,
      said he, the mistress should do the slave’s bidding. “That can be,” said he, “but at one time
      in the year, and should not be forgotten.” And the lanes are clear of rabble. If Paris here
      will walk on one side of you and I on the other, it will be well. That rascal Amphibolus I
      bade wait, but not he, said he, “Io Saturne!”” 
 “I will attend with joy,” announced the actor. 
 Domitia rose to leave, she tendered thanks to Glyceria and took two steps towards the
      entrance, halted,
      turned back, and taking the thin hand of the sick woman in hers, somewhat shyly
      said: 
 “I may come again and see you?” 
 Before Glyceria could reply, so great was her surprise, Domitia was gone. 
 The streets were nearly empty, they were mere lanes between huge blocks of windowless
      buildings, towering into the sky, but from the forum could be heard a hubbub of voices, cries,
      the clash of arms, and anon a cheer. 
 Presently—“Stand aside!” said Paris, and there swept down the lane a number of young
      fellows masked and tricked out in ribbons and scraps of tawdry finery. 
 “I am the king!” shouted one, “Præfect of the guard, arrest those people. Ha! a woman. She
      shall be my captive and grace my triumph.” 
 Eboracus administered a blow with his fist, planted between the eyes of the youth in
      pasteboard armor who came towards his young mistress. The blow sent him flying backwards
      against the king and upset him on the pavement. 
 A roar of laughter from his mates, and one shouted, 
 “Hey Tarquinius! thou must e’en fare like the rest, Nero, Galba, Otho—and hem! we know not
      who else—but down thou art with the others.” 
 “Let us go on,” said Paris, and without further attempt at molestation from the revellers
      they pursued their way. 
 On reaching the palace inhabited by Longa Duilia, a fresh difficulty arose. Eboracus
      knocked, but there was no porter at the door to answer. He knocked again and continued to
      rattle against the panels, till
      at length the bolt was withdrawn, and Euphrosyne with timid face, and holding a
      lamp appeared in the entrance. 
 “Why have you kept us so long waiting?” asked the Briton. 
 “Eboracus, I could not help myself. It is the Saturnalia, and the slaves will do no menial
      work. They are carousing in the triclinium and, though they heard the rap well enough, none
      would rise and respond. Then, for very shame I came, for I thought it might be my dear
      mistress.” 
 As Domitia crossed the atrium, she heard song and laughter and the click of goblets issue
      from the dining-room. She hurried by and entered her mother’s chamber. 
 Longa Duilia was in a condition of resentment and irritation. 
 “You have arrived at last!” said the lady. “I’ll have that British slave’s hide well basted
      when the Seven Days are over, for disregarding me and considering your safety alone. Body of
      Bacchus! This time of the Saturnalia is insufferable. Not a servant will do a stroke of work,
      nor execute a single order. They are all, forsooth, lords and ladies for seven days, and we
      must wait on them. Well! if it were not an old custom, I’d get up a procession of all the
      matrons of Rome to entreat the Senate to abolish the usage.” 
 “Oh, mother dear, how did you escape?” 
 “My child! it was as bad as that bit of storm we had getting out of the Gulf of Corinth,
      tossed about in my palanquin I hardly knew whether I were thinking with my head or with my
      toes. But after a while they got me through. Never, never again will I go
      gadding after the Gods to their Lectisternia. As the Gods love me! this is a
      topsy-turvy time indeed. At the Saturnalia no strife is permissible, not a lawsuit, all
      quarrels are supposed to cease, not even a malefactor may be executed, and there are those
      precious Immortals with their glass eyes, and extended hands snuffing up the fumes of their
      dinner, and they allow fighting to go on before them, under their immortal noses, and never
      interfere! But I don’t wonder. There was Summanus, God of the night thunders—and will you
      believe it, his own head was struck off by the heavenly bolt. Ye Gods! if ye cannot mind your
      own heads ye are not to be trusted with ours.” 
 The lady was in a condition of towering indignation. She was affronted—she, highborn, with
      a drop of Julian blood in her, somewhere,—she had been tossed about among the heads and over
      the shoulders of a dirty, garlic-smelling asafœtida chewing rabble—had been exposed to danger
      from the swords of the Vigiles on one side, of the Palatine guard on the other. And when
      finally, she reached home ruffled in garments, her hair in disorder, and her heart beating
      fast, she found the house in disorder, the slaves in possession keeping high holiday, and
      disregarding her shrilly uttered, imperiously expressed orders. 
 “I shall go to bed,” said the lady, “I’d lie in bed all these horrible seven days, but that
      I know no one will bring me my meals. Never mind—when the Saturnalia are over, I shall
      remember which were insolent and disobliging, and they shall get whippings.” 
 But in the house, on the morrow the condition of affairs was not quite so bad. The servants
      were alive to the fact that they had liberty for seven days only,
      and that their mistress had a faculty of remembering and punishing disobedience;
      not indeed during the holiday period, nor ostensibly because of faults then committed, but by
      administering double chastisement for light offences committed later. 
 Some of the slaves, moreover, made no attempt to use their liberty so as to cause
      inconvenience to their mistress. 
 But if some sort of order was established within the palace, none reigned without. There
      civil war raged, at the same time that the citizens observed the festival, and so long as they
      kept out of the way of the soldiery, it did not much concern them whether the city force or
      the palace garrison prevailed. Primus, at the head of the Illyrian legions was rapidly
      advancing on Rome. News had arrived that Spain and Gaul had declared for Vespasian. Britain
      had renounced allegiance to Vitellius, only Africa still remained faithful. 
 Next tidings arrived that the army of Vitellius that was at Narnia had surrendered.
      Thereupon the gross, aged Emperor dressed in black, surrounded by his servants, and carrying
      his son, still a child, came howling and sobbing from the Palatine through the Forum, to
      surrender the insignia of Empire into the hands of the Consul, in the Temple of Concord. But
      the Consul refused to receive them, and then the German guard, having wind of his intention,
      became clamorous, and cried out for the head of Flavius Sabinus. Vitellius, unable to resign,
      and incapable of reigning, wandered from one residence to another, asking advice of all his
      friends as to what he ought to do, but taking none. 
 Meanwhile the fighting in the streets of Rome had recommenced. Titus Flavius Sabinus, for
      security
      escaped into the Capitol, and took with him his sons and daughter, and his nephew
      Domitian. There he was formally besieged by the Imperial guard; and Sabinus, doubting his
      ability to hold out long, sent off a despatch to Primus to bid him hasten to his assistance. 
 “Madam!” exclaimed Eboracus rushing in, “I pray you come on the roof of the house.” 
 “What is the matter? Ye Gods! surely Rome is not on fire again!” 
 “Madam! The household guard are assaulting the Capitol and have indeed set fire to the
      houses below, I doubt if the Præfect can hold out till Primus arrives.” 
 Duilia ascended to the flat top of the house. The palace of the family was in the Carinæ,
      on the slope of the Esquiline hill, hard by the gardens of Nero’s Golden House. Being on high
      ground it commanded the Forum and the Capitol, and looked over the tops of the vulgar
       insulæ in the dip of the Suburra. 
 It was the evening of the second day. Heavy clouds had lowered throughout the hours of
      daylight and the evening had prematurely closed. There had been desultory fighting all day,
      but as the night approached a determined set was made by the German guard to capture the
      Capitol, and the citadel of Rome that adjoined it, connected by only a small neck of hill.
      They knew that Primus was close at hand, and they were determined not to be caught between a
      foe before and another behind. 
 The Capitol is a rocky height rising precipitately above the Forum, and enormous
      substructures had strengthened it and formed a platform on which rose the Temple of Jupiter
      Capitolinus that stood to Rome almost in the relation that the Temple did to Jeru
      salem, as the centre of its religious and civil institutions. 
 It was almost the paladium of the city, the fate of Rome was held to be bound up with its
      preservation. 
 And now Domitia and her mother looked on in the gathering darkness at the temple looming
      out as of gold against the purple black clouds behind, lit with the glare of the flames of the
      houses below that had been fired by the soldiery. 
 The roar of conflict came up in waves of sound. 
 “Really,” said Duilia, “Revolutions are only tolerable when seen from a house-top; that is,
      to cultivated minds—the common rabble like them.” 
 Shrill above the roar came the scream of a whistle, that a boy was blowing as he went down
      the street. 
 Suddenly the clamor boiled up into a mighty spout or geyser of noise, and the reason became
      manifest in another moment. The whole sky was lit by a sheet of flame of golden yellow. The
      conflagration had caught an oil merchant’s stores that were planted against the substructures
      supporting the temple. Columns, shoots of dazzling light rushed up against the rocks and the
      walls, recoiled, swept against them again, overleaped them and curled like tongues around the
      temple. 
 Instantly every sound ceased. The soldiers sheathed their swords. The citizens held their
      breath. Nothing for a few minutes was audible, save the mutter of the fire. 
 “My lady,” said Euphrosyne, coming to the roof, and addressing Longa Duilia, “A priest of
      Jupiter is below, and desires to speak with you.” 
 “A priest of Jupiter here!” exclaimed Duilia. “When his temple is on fire! Bid him be
      off—but stay. Who let him in?” 
 “Lady, the Chaldæan introduced him.” 
 “He had no right to do so. Let him entertain him. I desire to see the end. Run. The roof is
      on fire—the eagles will be down—or melt away.” 
 “Lady! the Magian commissioned me to assure you that he bears an important communication.” 
 “Say I am engaged.” 
 A minute later, the Chaldæan himself arrived on the housetop and addressed the mistress. 
 “I cannot attend to your abracadabra,” said she, in reply to his request to be heard. “Look
      there. The Capitol is in flames, the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus blazes. I know what he
      wants—he has come begging. They all beg. I have no money. I am interested in the fire, the
      Revolution, and all that sort of thing.” 
 “Lady Longa,” said Elymas, “There are moments that are turning points in every life. A
      great chance offers. Take it, or put it away forever.” 
 “You worry me past endurance. What is it? Look! the flames are licking Jupiter in his
      chariot.” 
 “If you will step aside I will speak. Not here.” 
 Duilia with an impatient toss of her head and shrug of her shoulders, gathered up her
      garment with one hand, stepped to a distant part of the roof, and said, sulkily— 
 “Well, what is this about?” 
 “You know that the Præfect of Rome who supped at your house the other day is besieged in
      the Capitol.” 
 “Well—this is no news.” 
 “And that for security, lest they should be put to death by Vitellius or the soldiery, he
      took his children and his nephew there with him.” 
 “So I have been told. That does not concern me. Why did he not take also his fat wife? she
      would have fed the flames.” 
 “My lady—the Capitol cannot hold out another half hour, and then all within will be
      butchered.” 
 “Can I help that? They all do it. This sort of thing happens in revolutions invariably. I
      cannot alter the course of the world.” 
 “But, madam, the son of Vespasian, Flavius Domitianus has escaped through the Tabularium,
      by a little door into the Forum.” 
 “He might have escaped by turning a somersault over the walls for aught I care.” 
 “His life is in extreme jeopardy. If discovered he will be assassinated, most assuredly.” 
 “Well, that is the way these things go.” 
 “I have brought him hither—disguised as a priest.” 
 “What!” 
 The lady became rigid, eyes, mouth and nostrils. 
 “What!” 
 “He escaped disguised as a priest of Jupiter. As
      such, with veiled head he has passed unmolested, even through the ranks of the
      soldiery and people, inclined to tear him to pieces, for they are all on the side of the
      reigning prince.” 
 “Domitian here! What a fool you are, Elymas. I’ll have you tossed off the roof, in
      punishment. By Hercules! you compromise me. If it be suspected that he is here, I shall have
      the house ransacked, and all my valuables plundered, and the Gods alone know what may become
      of me.” 
 “That is true, lady, and you must run the risk.” 
 “I will not,” said Duilia, stamping angrily on the concrete of the roof. “Is it not enough
      to have the house turned upside down with this detestable Saturnalia! Age of Gold indeed! Age
      of tomfoolery and upside-downedness. If my poor dear man had but done what he ought, there
      would have been none of these commotions, and I—well—I—I would have put down the Saturnalia.” 
 “Madam, this is all beside the mark. Domitian, the son of Flavius Vespasian, whom the world
      has saluted Emperor, and sworn to, is under your roof as a suppliant.” 
 “How unfortunate!” 
 “How fortunate!” 
 “I cannot see that.” 
 “Then, madam, the clouds of night must have got into your brain. Do you not see that you
      are running a very slight risk. None suspect that he is in concealment here, as I smuggled him
      into the house.” 
 “There are my slaves.” 
 “They regard him as a priest escaping from the fire and the siege,” said the soothsayer. He continued—
      “Before morning the Illyrian legions will have arrived in Rome. Do you suppose
      the German bodyguard can stand against them? What other troops has Vitellius to fall back on?
      None—he is deserted. His cause is fatally smitten. By to-morrow evening he will be dead, cast
      down the Gemonian stair. Vespasian will be proclaimed in the Forum. Your risk will be at an
      end, and you will have obtained the lasting gratitude of the Imperial father, who will do
      anything you desire, to show his thankfulness to you for having saved the life of his son.” 
 “There is something in that,” said Duilia. 
 “And suppose now that Domitian is here, that you bid your slaves eject him, and he falls
      into the hands of Vitellius, how will you be regarded by the Flavian family? Do you not
      suppose that you will be the first to suffer the resentment of the Augustus?” 
 “There is a good deal in that,” said Duilia, to which the Magus said,— 
 “I have no fear of betrayal from any in the house save Senecio, that owl-like philosopher.
      He is not like the slaves, he may suspect, and trip me up.” 
 “My good Elymas,” interrupted Duilia, “do not concern yourself about him. He is not a man
      to chew nutshells when he can munch kernels.” 
 “Domitian is in my apartment, will you see him, lady?” 
 “By all means. I have a notion. Go, fetch Domitia, bring her down there to me.” 
 Then Longa descended to that portion of the mansion where were situated the rooms given up
      to the soothsayer; they were on one side of a small court, and the philosopher occupied
      chambers on the other side.
      Across the water tank in the midst many an altercation had taken place. 
 Senecio was not there now. He was probably out taking a philosophic view of the internecine
      strife, and moralizing over the burning of the Capitol. 
 With a benignant smile and a tear in her eye, Duilia almost ran to Domitian, her two hands
      extended. She had just looked round the court to make sure she was unobserved and that there
      was no one within earshot. 
 “I am so grateful to the Gods,” she said, with a tremor in her voice, “that they should
      allow me the honor and happiness of offering you an asylum. Blood is thicker than water.
      Though I perish for my advocacy of your dear father—I cannot help it. Cousins must be
      cousinly. It is with us a family peculiarity—we hang together like a swarm of bees.” 
 The young man cautiously removed his white veil or head-covering, and exposed his face,
      that was somewhat pale. He had a shy modest appearance, a delicate complexion that flushed and
      paled at the changes of emotion in his heart. His eyes were a watery gray, large, but he
      screwed the eyelids together, as though near-sighted. He was fairly well built, but had
      spindle legs, no calves, and his toes as if cut short. 
 In manner he was awkward, without ease in his address; owing to the low associates with
      whom he had consorted, having been kept short of money, and to his lack of acquaintance with
      the courtesies of the cultured classes. 
 “I thank you. My life is in danger. I came hither, as my uncle supped here the other day,
      and I knew something about kinship. I had nowhere else whither to go. I would have been hunted
      out and murdered
      had I gone to my uncle—my mother’s brother. They would have sought me there first
      of all.” 
 “You shall stay here till all danger is past. I should esteem myself the vilest of women
      were I to refuse you my protection at such a time as this. Senecio, my philosopher, is out,
      gadding about—of course. You shall occupy his room, and I shall give strict orders that he be
      not admitted. I will not have philosophers careering in and out of my house, at all hours, as
      pleases them. This is not a rabbit warren, as the Gods love me! But here comes my daughter to
      unite with me in assurance of welcome and protection.” 
 Domitia had entered, in obedience to the command transmitted by the sorcerer. 
 There was but one oil lamp on a table in the chamber, and consequently at first she did not
      discern who was there addressed by her mother. But Duilia stepped aside and allowed the light
      to flash over the face of Domitian. 
 The moment the girl saw it, she started back and put her hands to her bosom. 
 “My dear child,” said Longa Duilia, “you will thank the Lares and Penates, that our cousin
      has taken refuge with us. The Capitol is in flames, the Imperial guards are storming the
      walls, there is, I fear, no hope for our dear good friend Flavius Sabinus. Poor man, how he
      enjoyed himself at supper here the other day! We may hope for the best, but not expect
      impossibilities. Revolutions and all these sorts of things have their natural exits, the
      sword, the Tullianum and the Gemonian steps—horrible, but inevitable. Domitian has fled to us,
      disguised as a priest of Jupiter. O my dear, what a nice thing it is that there is so much
      religion
      left among the common people that they respected his cloth. Well, here he is, and
      we must do what we can for him.” 
 “Cast him out,” said Domitia hoarsely. 
 “What, my love?” 
 “Cast him out—the beast, the crowned beast, the new Nero. The fifth that was and the eighth
      that will be.” 
 Duilia raised her eyebrows. 
 “My dear, I don’t in the least understand enigmas. I was never clever at them, though my
      parts are not generally accounted bad.” 
 “Mother, I pray you, I beseech you as you desire my happiness, do not harbor him under your
      roof. Cast him forth. What ho! Slaves!” 
 Domitian started and caught the girl by the shoulders. 
 “You would betray me?” 
 “I would have you thrust forth into the street.” 
 “To be murdered—torn to pieces by the blood-thirsty mob?” 
 “It is to save myself.” 
 “Thyself! I do thee no harm.” 
 “Do not attend to her. It is childish, maidenly timidity,” said Duilia, frowning at Domitia
      and shaking her finger at her. “She knows that, to screen you, we run great risks ourselves.
      We may be denounced—we may.—As the Gods love me! There is no saying what we may be called on
      to suffer. But I say, perish all the family rather than offend against hospitality.” 
 “Mother,” said Domitia. Her face was white as ashes. “Send him forth. If he were not a
      coward, a mean coward, he would not come here, to the house of two women, and shelter himself
      behind their
      skirts. Titus Flavius Domitianus, dost thou call thyself a man?” 
 He looked furtively at the girl, and muttered something that was unintelligible. 
 “If thou art a man, go forth, run us not into danger. If thou tarry here—I esteem thee as
      the basest of men.” 
 “I praise the Gods!” said Longa Duilia, in towering wrath, “she does not command in this
      house. That do I; and when I say welcome, there you stay, and she shall not gainsay me.” 
 “Mother—to welcome him, is to exile, to destroy me.” 
 “This is rank folly.” 
 “Mother, eject him!” 
 “I will not. I prithee, Domitian, when your dear father is proclaimed in Rome,—forget this
      girl’s folly, and remember only that I sheltered thee.” 
 “I will remember. I am not one to forget.” 
 “There is no escape,” sighed Domitia. “Whom the Gods will destroy—they pursue
      remorselessly. Well, be it so.—Stay then, coward! I am undone.” 
 “I never made a greater mistake in my life,” said Longa Duilia, “and I cannot think how you
      allowed me to make it.” 
 “What mistake?” asked the Chaldæan. 
 “The mistake of inviting the uncle in place of the nephew to my little supper. As to that
      supper, I flatter myself it was perfect—so finished in every detail, as becomes our position;
      so delicately flavored with reserve, as became my position as a widow; and you
      recommended me to invite Flavius Sabinus, the Præfect,—and now he has been. That
      delicate little supper thrown away, and my attentions so nicely adjusted to the circumstances,
      all that trouble and thought gone for nothing. Do you know that Flavius Sabinus is now in
      bits? He has been positively hacked to pieces. It is not the supper itself I regret, and my
      best Falernian wine—but I gave him a gold signet-ring with a cameo, representing Daphne. It
      had belonged to my dear Corbulo, and was valuable. But I considered it as a means to an end.
      And now—where is that ring? But for your counsel, I might have invited the nephew.” 
 “Madam, I counselled aright.” 
 “You have the face to say that? Do you not know that Sabinus has had his head struck off,
      and his body
      dragged by hooks down the Gemonian stair, and then positively torn to pieces—but
      there? Who has got hold of the ring? I have lost it—through you. You pretend to read
      the stars and peer into futurity!” 
 “Lady, I do see into what is to be, and counsel accordingly.” 
 “Oh, yes! glimpses as of light in a wood through thick foliage. Plenty of obscurity, very
      little light.” 
 “Madam, consider. Had you not invited the Præfect who has been, you would not have seen the
      nephew who is, and who came in at the supper to call his uncle away. It was thus he arrived at
      a knowledge of your house, and your friendly disposition, and thus it was that he was induced
      to throw himself on your protection.” 
 “There is something in that,” observed Duilia. “But how much better had the invitation been
      sent to Domitian himself.” 
 “On the contrary, that would not have been judicious, therefore I did not recommend it. Had
      the nephew come here along with his servants, immediately his escape from the Capitol was
      discovered, and they were tortured to disclose his place of concealment, they would have
      betrayed this house: but as it has happened they could not suppose he would take refuge here.” 
 “There is a good deal in that,” answered Duilia meditatively. “Well, it is only the ring
      that I regret. If I had but known—something of inconsiderable value but showy would have
      sufficed. Moreover, I might have done without that dish of British oysters—very expensive,
      and, as you see, thrown away. Yet! well, I enjoyed them.” 
 “Even that ring is not lost.” 
 “How so?” 
 “It is on Domitian’s finger.” 
 “You really say so?” 
 “When the Præfect bade his nephew and sons attempt to escape from the Capitol, he
      recommended the former to engage your protection, and in token of this, he put the ring that
      you had given him, on his nephew’s finger, that he might present it to you—should there be
      mistrust, in pledge that he came from Flavius Sabinus. I encountered Domitian in the street, I
      knew him and conducted him to your door, and obtained his admission. There was no necessity
      for him to show his ring, as I stood sponsor for him.” 
 “You are a good old creature,” said Duilia, “I withdraw any offensive expressions I may
      have used. To gratify you, I will pay that old woman, Senecio, his wage and bid him pack.” 
 “Then, madam, my services shall be amply repaid. The man himself is harmless. Engage him as
      a clown,—he is consumed with conceit, and so renders himself a laughing-stock. That is all he
      is qualified to be.” 
 “Go—send me Domitia. She has behaved like a fool.” 
 Shortly after the girl entered the room where was her mother. The latter at once
      exclaimed:— 
 “My dear, the ring is not lost. Domitian has it. By the foresight of the Gods,
      Sabinus removed it from his finger, and confided it to his nephew, before unhappy
      circumstances arose which might have led to the ring getting into the hands of any Cyrus or
      Dromo.” 
 “Was it to hear this that you sent for me?” asked Domitia sullenly. 
 “No, it was not. Your conscience must upbraid you.
      You have acted in an insensate manner. You have flouted and angered
      the son of him who in—perhaps half an hour—will be an Augustus, supreme in the state.” 
 “Mother, I do not like him.” 
 “Ye Gods of the Capitol!—confound them, by the way, they are all burnt! O Tellus and
      Terminus! Do you suppose we are to see and be courteous only to those whom we like? What cared
      I for that paragon of virtue, Flavius Sabinus, who talked to such an extent that I could not
      get in a word edgeways. But I gave him a nice little supper—and oysters from Britain, my best
      Falernian, and that ring of your father’s, because I thought he might be useful. And now Titus
      Flavius Domitianus is our guest—in hiding till matters are settled one way or the other—and
      you insult him to his face. It is not conduct worthy of your mother. You interfere with my
      plans.” 
 “What plans?” 
 “My dear child, Vespasian is old—about sixty I think, and has but two sons, of whom
      Domitian is the youngest. The elder, Titus Flavius Sabinus Vespasianus has but a daughter. Do
      you not see? Do you not smell?” 
 “I do neither, mother.” 
 “More the pity. You sadly take after your father, who had no ambition. Give the old fellow
      ten years before he becomes a god; the eldest son, if the worst comes, may succeed and be
      Augustus for another ten, and then,—the second son, Domitian, will be prince. My dear, what
      opportunities! What gorgeous opportunities!” 
 “Opportunities for what?” 
 “For push, my dear, push to the purple. Your dear father, ah, well! We are not all made of
      the same clay.” 
 “Mother, that is precisely what fills me with dread. He will then be the eighth, for these
      adventurers of a few months do not count,—the new Nero.” 
 “But consider—the purple. My dear, do you remember how Valeria caught the dictator Sulla.
      She sat behind him in the theatre, and picked some flue off his toga. He turned round and
      caught her doing it. “Sir,” said she, “I am but endeavoring to get to myself some of the luck
      that adheres to you!” I could have loved that woman. It was so happy, so neat. That bit of
      wool drew Sulla and the Dictatorship to her. You, what a blunderer you are. You have offended
      Domitian, who may some day be greater than was Sulla, when you had it in your power by a word,
      a look, a dimpled smile, to win him, and with him the purple.” 
 “Mother, I do not covet it. You forget—I am promised to Lucius Ælius Lamia.” 
 “Oh! Lamia! He could be bought off with a proconsulship.” 
 “I do not desire to be separated from him. I love him, and have loved him since we were
      children together.” 
 “Well, you have done for your chances. If I surmise aright, the young man entertains a
      great grudge against you.” 
 At that moment Eboracus came in. 
 “Madam,” said he, “the Illyrian legions have entered the city, under Primus, and there is
      fighting in the streets. The people on the housetops cheer on
      this side or that, as though they were at a show of gladiators.” 
 “Well—those things happen. We shall know for certain which shall be uppermost, and if fate
      favors Vitellius—Then, daughter, I shall not scruple to give the young man up.” 
 The condition of the capital was frightful. Vitellius had called in levies from the country
      to support him, and the prætorian soldiers stood firm. But many men of direction were with the
      partisans of Vespasian, who advanced steadily over the bodies of the troops opposing them.
      Fifty thousand persons lost their lives in these eventful days of the Saturnalia. 
 The legions under Primus succeeded in recapturing the Capitol, which was still smoking, and
      pushed forward into the Forum. 
 Meanwhile, Vitellius, in the Palatine palace, a prey to irresolution, had filled himself
      with wine, and then fled along with his cook and pastrycook to his wife’s house on the
      Aventine. Then deceived by a false report that his troops were successful, he returned to the
      Palatine, and found it deserted, but a roar of voices rose from the Forum below, and from the
      Capitol the cries of the legionaries were wafted towards him along with the smoke. 
 He hastened to collect all the gold he could lay his hands on, stuffed it into his
      cincture, assumed an old ragged suit, and then again attempted to escape; but now he found
      every avenue blocked. Filled with terror he crawled into the dog-kennel where the hounds,
      resenting the intrusion, fell on him and bit his neck and hands and legs. But now Vespasian’s
      soldiery invaded the palace, and a tribune, Julius Placidius, dis
      covering the bloated, bleeding wretch, drew him out by the foot, and he came
      forth thus, his hands full of dirty straw, and strands adhering to his hair and garments. A
      howling rabble at once surrounded him, leaping, jeering, throwing mud and stones; a few
      soldiers succeeded in surrounding him. His hands were bound behind his back, and a rope passed
      about his neck. Thus he was dragged through the streets an object of insult to the people.
      Some struck him in the face, some plucked out his hair. In the Forum the rabble were breaking
      his statues and dragging them about. One ruffian thrust a pike under the unfortunate prince’s
      chin and bade him hold up his head. Then said Vitellius:— 
 “Thou, who thus addressest me—a tribune thou art, remember I was once thy commander!” 
 Thereupon a German soldier, desirous of shortening his misery, struck him down with a blow
      of his sword, and in so doing cut off the ear of the tribune who had insulted the fallen
      Emperor. 
 At once the body of the prince, from whom the life was not sped, was dragged to the
      Gemonian stair, a flight of steps down which the corpses of malefactors were flung, and there
      he was despatched with daggers. 
 Longa Duilia had been kept well informed as to all that took place. 
 No sooner was she assured that Vitellius was dead, than she rushed into the apartment given
      up to Domitian. 
 “Salve, Cæsar! As the Gods love me, I am the first to so salute you, son of the Augustus!
      Oh, I am so happy! And it might have been otherwise, but you they never would have
      reached save over my body.” 
 The anarchy which had lasted from the 11th June, 68, when Nero perished, came to an end on
      the 20th December, in the ensuing year. In that terrible year of 69, three emperors had died
      violent deaths, and Rome had been in a condition of disorder on each occasion, and
      intermittent violence had lasted all the time. Men now drew a long breath, they were disposed
      to blot out the memory of those eighteen months of misery and national humiliation, as though
      it had not been, and to reckon the strong Vespasian as prince next after Nero. Indeed, on the
      morrow of the death of Vitellius, when the Senate assembled and decreed the honors of the
      former princes, they recited those of the first Cæsars, but ignored the three last who had
      perished within a twelvemonth, as though they had never been, and were to be forgotten as an
      evil dream. 
 That same day also, Domitian received the title of Cæsar, and was made Prince of the
      Youths, and Præfect of Rome in the place of his uncle, who had been murdered. 
 That day, also, Mucianus arrived with the Syrian legions, and with plenitude of authority
      from Vespasian to act in his name. 
 To Duilia’s vast delight Domitian did not forget his
      obligation to her, but paid frequent visits to her house, and it was a matter of
      pride to her to have his attendant lictors standing outside her door, as in former days. 
 When he came, she made a point of summoning her daughter, and requiring her to be present
      during the interview. But she could not make her speak or compel her to graciousness of manner
      towards the visitor. 
 The young prince’s eyes watched the girl with question in them, but he addressed all his
      conversation to the mother. 
 Longa Duilia did her utmost to disguise her child’s incivility, attributed it to shyness,
      and used all her blandishments to make a visit to her house agreeable to Domitian. 
 At length, the irksomeness caused by Domitia’s irresponsive manner seemed to satisfy the
      mother that she did more harm than good in enforcing her attendance, and she ceased to require
      the girl to appear. 
 Some months passed, and Domitia had not given a thought to Glyceria, and her offer to
      revisit the sick woman, when, all at once, in a fit of weariness with all things that
      surrounded her, and a sense of incapacity to find enjoyment anywhere, she started from her
      languor to bid Eboracus go forth, buy honey-cakes and toys, and accompany her on a visit to
      the Suburra. 
 As she was on her way, Domitian came by with his lictors and other attendants. Since his
      elevation from poverty and insignificance to ease and importance, he had acquired a swagger
      that made his manner more offensive than before in his phase of cubbishness. 
 He at once addressed her, for though veiled he recognized her. 
 “May I attend you? I have at the moment nothing of importance to occupy me.” 
 “I am bound for the Suburra.” 
 “For the Suburra! What can take you into the slums of Rome?” 
 “I am going to see the wife of Paris, the tragic actor.” 
 “Oh! the wife of the actor, Paris,” with a sneer. 
 “I said so—the wife of Paris the actor,” she withdrew her veil and looked him straight in
      the eyes. He winced. 
 “And pray—is she a visiting acquaintance of the family?” 
 “She is our freedwoman. Paris was freed by my father likewise. Are you content? I may add
      that she has met with an accident and is crippled and confined to her bed.” 
 “Oh!” with a vulgar laugh, “and you are infected with the Christian malady, and go among
      the sick and starving.” 
 “I know naught of this Christian malady. What is it?” 
 “We have had the contagion touch us. There is my cousin Clemens, and his wife Domitilla,
      both taken badly with it. He is a poor, mean-spirited fool. He has been offered excellent
      situations, with money to be made in them, in bushels, but he refuses—will not swear by the
      genius of my father, will not offer sacrifice to the Gods. Such thin gruel minds I cannot away
      with. Were I Augustus, such as would not serve the Commonwealth should be sent to kick their
      heels in a desert island. These Christians are the enemies of the human race.” 
 “What, because they visit the sick and relieve the poor?” 
 “The sick are smitten by the Gods and should be left to die. The poor are encumbrances and
      should be left to rot away. But a man of rank and of family—” 
 “Flavius Clemens! of what family?” 
 Domitian bit his lip. The Flavians were of no ancestry; money-lenders, tax-collectors,
      jobbers in various ways, with no connections save through the mother of Vespasian, and that
      middle-class only. 
 “I say that a man who will not serve his country should be pitched out of it.” 
 “About that I have no opinion.” 
 “Clemens was cast to the lions by Nero, but some witchcraft charmed them, and they would
      not touch him.” 
 Domitia said nothing to this. She was desirous of being rid of her self-imposed escort. 
 “You must wish me success,” said the young prince. “I am off to Germany. There has been
      revolt there, and I go to subdue it.” 
 “By all means carry with you a pair of shears.” 
 “What mean you?” 
 “To obtain a crop of golden hair from the German women, wherewith to grace your triumph.” 
 Domitian knitted his brows. 
 “You have a sharp tongue.” 
 “I need one. It is a woman’s sole defence.” 
 “Come, if a cousin, as your mother asserts,—though by the Gods! I know not where the
      kinship comes in,—wish me well. Such words as yours are of ill-omen.” 
 “I wish confusion and destruction to the worst enemies of Rome,” answered Domitia. 
 “That suffices. I will offer the spoils to you.” 
 “Thank you, I do not yet wear wigs.” 
 He turned away with an expression of irritation. 
 “You are either silent, or stick pins into me,” he muttered. 
 Domitia continued her course, but as she entered the “Island” in which was the home of
      Paris, she observed the young Cæsar still in the street, at a corner watching her. 
 Much annoyed, and with her temper ruffled by this meeting, she ascended the steps to the
      first story and at once turned towards the apartments of Paris and Glyceria, but had to thread
      her way among poor people, women weaving and spinning, and children romping and running races. 
 She was welcomed with pleasure, Glyceria would have raised herself, had she been able; as
      it was, she could show her respect only by a salutation with the hand, and her pleasure by a
      smile and a word. 
 The chamber was fragrant with violets. 
 Domitia looked round and saw a small marble table on which stood a statuette of a shepherd
      with panpipes, and a lamb across his shoulders. Violets in a basin stood before the figure. 
 “Ah! Hermes,” said Domitia, and plucking a little bunch of the purple flowers from her
      bosom she laid it in the bowl with the rest. 
 “Nay, dear Lady, not Hermes,” said Glyceria, “though indeed it was sculptured to represent
      him—but to me that figure has another meaning. And I hold your offering of the violets as made
      to Him who to me is the Good Shepherd.”
     
 “Whom mean you? Atys?” 
 “Not Atys.” 
 Domitia was not particularly interested in the matter. She presumed that some foreign cult
      was followed by Glyceria, and foreign cults at this time swarmed in Rome. 
 “Do you believe me, Glyceria,” said Domitia, “as I came hither, the Cæsar Domitian
      accompanied me, and said that I must be a Christian to care for the sick and suffering. What
      are these Christians?” 
 “I am one,” answered the paralyzed woman. 
 “What! and Paris?” 
 “Nay, he hovers between two opinions. His business holds him and he will not give that up,
      he thinks that, were he to do so, he and I might starve. But with the mind I think he is one.” 
 “And what are these Christians?” 
 “Those who believe in Christ.” 
 “And he?—is that his image?” pointing to the Good Shepherd. 
 “Oh Lady! it is only so much His image as the words Good Shepherd written in characters are
      such, they call up a notion and so does that figure. But in our worship we have no images, no
      sacrifices.” 
 “What is Christianity?” 
 “That is long to answer, but I may say in two words what it is to me.” 
 “Say on.” 
 “The Daylight of the soul.” 
 “How mean you?” 
 “I once was in darkness. I knew not why I was set in the world, whither I was going, what I
      ought to worship, what were my duties, where was right and
      what was wrong. I had no light, no road, no law. Now I have all.” 
 “So every votary of every new religion says. Where is your guarantee that you are not in
      delusion?” 
 “Madam, when the sun rises and there is day, you do not suppose the light, the splendor,
      the confidence inspired by it is a delusion. You know that you see, and see that you may walk,
      and act with purpose and direction. The soul has eyes as well as the body. These eyes behold
      the light and cannot doubt it, by internal conscience that distinguishes between the truth and
      falsehood. By that internal conscience I am assured that the light is as real as that seen by
      eyes of flesh.” 
 “I cannot understand you,” said Domitia. “Now for other matters—I have made Eboracus bring
      you some dainties for yourself and presents for the children who are so kind to you. Where is
      your husband?” 
 “He is rehearsing. Better times have arrived, and he is now occupied.” 
 “And you see less of him.” 
 “Yes—but we must live. When away from me, I know that in heart he is with me.” 
 “You are sure of that?” 
 “Yes.” 
 “What, by the conscience that establishes between truth and falsehood?” 
 “Nay—by trust. We must trust some one and some thing. We trust God, we trust His
      Revelation, we trust in the goodness there is in mankind.” 
 “There is evil rather than good.” 
 “There is good—but that is oft astray because of the darkness, and does not know its
      course.” 
 Domitia did not remain long in the Insula. She
      bade farewell to the wife of the actor and promised to revisit her. The presence
      of Glyceria refreshed, soothed, sweetened the mind of the girl that was heated, ruffled and
      soured by contact with so much there was in pagan life that jarred against her noble
      instincts, by the uncongeniality of her mother, and by the disgust she felt at association
      with Domitian. 
 When she arrived at the palace, she heard that her mother had been inquiring after her, and
      she at once went to her apartments. 
 Duilia asked where she had been, but did not listen for an answer, or pay attention to what
      was said, when the reply came. 
 “What is this I hear?” said Duilia, in a tone of irritation. “Lucilla tells me you have
      been chatting with Domitian, and in the street too——” 
 “I had no wish to speak with him. He came after me.” 
 “Oh! he went after you, did he? And pray what had he to say?” 
 “He is going to Germany to conclude a campaign already fought out and come back and triumph
      for another man’s victories.” 
 “You did not say so to him?” 
 “Not in so many words.” 
 “My dear, it is true. He is going, and whether he be successful or not, will return wearing
      the title Germanicus. I shall have a little supper.” 
 “For whom?” 
 “For whom, do you ask? For him to be sure, to wish him good success on the expedition.” 
 “You will allow me not to be present.” 
 “As you will, perverse girl. My dear,” in a confidential tone, “if kittens can’t catch
      rats, cats can.” 
 “My dear,” said Longa Duilia to her daughter, “with wit such as you have, that might be
      drawn through a needle’s eye, it is positively necessary to have you married as quickly as
      possible. I can no longer bear the responsibility of one so full of waywardness and humors as
      yourself.” 
 “That, mother, is as Lamia chooses. You know that I can marry only him.” 
 “And I do not ask you to take another. I will get it settled forthwith. I’ll see his father
      by adoption and have the settlements looked to. You are a good match. I presume you are aware
      of that, and this explains certain poutings and bad temper. Well—reserve them for Lamia, and
      don’t vex me. I wash my hands of you, when that you are married. A camel carries his own hump,
      but a man his wife’s humors.” 
 Domitia was sufficiently acquainted with her mother’s elasticity of spirit and fertility of
      invention to be satisfied that she had a motive for pressing on her marriage, and what that
      motive was seemed obvious. But it was one that distressed her greatly. 
 “My dearest mother,” she said timidly, “I hope—I mean, since you are so good as not to urge
      me further to break my engagement with Lamia, that you have not set your mind—I mean your
      heart——” 
 “My excellent child,” answered Longa Duilia cutting her daughter short, “make no scruple of
      blurting out what is on your tongue. You allude to Domitian. Well! If you had common sense,
      you would know that to get on in life, one must fit one’s heart with the legs of a
      grasshopper, so as to be able to skip from an inconvenient, into any suitable position. When a
      dish of ortolans is set on table, none but a fool will dismiss it untasted to be devoured by
      the servants in the kitchen!” 
 “But, mother, he is quite young.” 
 “By the favor of the Gods, Domitia, youths always fall in love with women somewhat older
      than themselves. The Gods ordered it for their good. If they, I mean the young men—would only
      follow their—I mean the Gods’—direction, there would be fewer unhappy marriages. For my part,
      I can’t see anything attractive in half-baked girls.” 
 But the thoughts of her own future, and approaching happiness took up the whole of
      Domitia’s brain, and left no space for consideration of her mother’s schemes, and their
      chances of success. 
 The young prince was away. It was, as had been feared, too late for him to reap laurels in
      Germany, the revolt had been quelled by Cerealis, but as there was a ferment working in Gaul,
      it was deemed advisable that Domitian should go thither and overcome the dissatisfied instead
      of crossing the Alps. He had accordingly changed his route, and had appeared in Lyons. 
 The marriage between Domitia and Lamia could not take place so speedily as Duilia desired.
      She was wishful to have it over before the return to Rome of Domitian, so that she might be
      left a freer hand, and
      her daughter put out of the way who, she thought, exercised a peculiar
      fascination over the young prince; but she was unable to decide in her own mind whether what
      drew his eyes towards Domitia was dislike or love; possibly it was a commingling of resentment
      at her treatment of him, and admiration for her loveliness. 
 But hindrances arose. Lamia was absent on his estates in Sicily, where there had been
      disturbances among the slaves, and till matters were settled there, he could not return. 
 Then came the month of May in which no marriages might be performed owing to the hauntings
      of the Lemures, or ghosts of bad men, and such as had not received burial.
      These, seen in the forms of walking skeletons or bugbears, rioted in that sweetest month of
      the whole year. Then they obtained opportunities among the incautious to slip into their
      bodies, and possess them with madness, or to take up their abodes in dwelling-houses and
      disturb the living occupants by phantom appearances and mysterious sounds. 
 On three days in the month of May special means were adopted to propitiate or scare away
      these spectres. On the 9th, 11th, and 13th, at midnight, the master of a house, or, in the
      event of his death or absence, his widow or wife, walked barefoot before the door to a flowing
      fountain, where the hands were thrice washed, and then the propitiator of the ghosts returned
      home, and threw black beans over the shoulder, saying: “These I give to you, and with these
      beans I ransom myself and mine.” 
 It was supposed that the ghost scrambled for the beans, and so enabled the owner of the
      house to reach
      the door before them. There stood the servants beating brazen vessels, pots and
      pans, shouting, “Out with you! Out with you, ye ghosts!” 
 At the beginning of June was the cleansing of the Temple of Vesta, and till that was
      completed, on the 15th, marriages were forbidden. 
 Consequently the wedding could not take place much before midsummer, and to this Longa
      Duilia had to submit. 
 Domitia was content and happy. She had not been so happy since her father’s death. Indeed
      till now she had not been able to shake off the pain she had felt at his loss. For to her,
      that father was the model of noble manhood, high-minded, full of integrity, strong yet gentle.
      She had often marvelled at the manner in which he had dealt with her mother, whom she indeed
      loved but who somewhat rasped her. With his wife he had ever been firm yet forbearing. He
      allowed her to form her little schemes, but always managed to thwart them when foolish or
      mischievous, without her perceiving who had put a spoke in the wheel. 
 Lucius Ælius Lamia she looked upon as formed in her father’s school, upon his model. He was
      modest, honorable, true; a good man to whom she could give her whole heart with full assurance
      that he would treasure the gift, and that she could trust him to be as true to her as she
      would be true to him. 
 Since her father’s death, Domitia had felt more than previously the incompatibility of her
      mind with that of her mother. They had no thoughts, no wishes, no feelings in common. Domitia
      was a dreamer, speculative, ever with eager mind seeking the things beyond what was known,
      whereas Duilia had not a thought, a
      care that were not material. The lady Duilia cared not a rush about philosophy or
      the theory of emanations. It was to her a matter of complete indifference whether the
      established paganism was true or false. For she had no apprehension of the importance of
      Truth. And she had no wish that could not be gratified by money or the acquisition of
      position. 
 Now also the haunting horror of those waking dreams that she had seen in the Temple of Isis
      passed from the heart of the young girl, like the vapors that roll away and disclose the blue
      heavens and the glorious sun. She had been drifting purposeless; now she saw that she was
      about to enter on a condition of life in which she would have an object, and would find
      complete happiness in the pursuit of that object,—in the fulfilment of her duties as housewife
      to a loved husband, in whom she would find strength, sympathy and love. 
 And now also, for the first time since the death of Corbulo, she sang as she went about the
      house, or worked at her bridal dress. 
 Lamia, on his return from Sicily was surprised to note the change in her appearance. She
      had been as a beautiful flower bowed by rain and pinched with cold, and now, as in renewed
      sunshine, she bloomed with expanded petals. Light danced in her blue eyes, and a delicate rose
      suffused her smooth cheeks. She had stepped back into the childhood out of which she had
      passed on that terrible day at Cenchræa. 
 And as he looked at her, her eyes sparkling with love and tears of joy, he thought he had
      never seen one sweeter and to whom he could so wholly devote himself as to his dear Domitia. 
 Then arrived the eve of the marriage. 
 The young girl was in the garden, stooping, picking the flowers of which her virginal crown
      was to be woven, and singing as she plucked. 
 Then she came with her lap full of herbs and blossoms to her mother, who said:— 
 “That is right. None may gather the flowers but the bride. By the way, have you heard?
      Domitian is back from Gaul. I was rejoiced at the news, and have despatched an invitation to
      him to attend the wedding.” 
 “Oh, mother! it is a bad omen.” 
 At the mention of the name, the vision of the red face, seen at Gabii between her own and
      that of Lamia, started up before her, and she let drop the lap of flowers, and they fell at
      her feet. 
 “By the Gods! what a silly thing thou art! Quick, gather up the herbs and then go fetch thy
      dolls and toys of childhood, they must all this evening be offered on the altar of the
      household gods.” 
 “I have them not, mother.” 
 “Not your dolls!” 
 “Not one.” 
 “But what have you done with them? I know they were all brought from Antioch.” 
 “Mother, they have been given away.” 
 “Given away! to whom?” 
 “To Glyceria, the sister of Euphrosyne.” 
 “But what can have induced you to do this?” 
 “She is paralyzed, and served by little children in the story of the
       Insula where she lives. I considered that it would amuse her to dress the
      dolls afresh, and perhaps mend broken limbs, and after that she will
      distribute them among the little willing children that help her in her
      infirmity.” 
 “As the Gods love me!” exclaimed Duilia, “Whoever heard before of such madness. Hellebore
      would not cure it. Verily the more you labor at a hole the greater the hollow. You are a fool,
      and your folly grows daily greater. You must present your toys of childhood to the
       Lares, they expect it—it is the custom, it is right.” 
 “But I have none left.” 
 “Mother Ops! what is to be done? Run, Eboracus,—run and buy me half a dozen dolls—dressed
      if possible. Domitia, you are determined to bring ill-luck on yourself. There is nothing else
      to be done but for you to spend an hour in playing with the dolls, and then you can present
      them at the altar, and the Gods will be none the wiser. Between me and you and the pillars of
      the peristyle, they are bigger fools than us mortals, and easier gulled.” 
 Domitia stooped to collect the fallen flowers. 
 “What is that?” asked her mother—“Oh! right enough, natrix, that drives away ghosts and nightmare. And that of course is in the
      virginal wreath, myosotis (Forget-me-not) it dries tears. An Egyptian slave
      I had—he fell ill, so I exposed him on the isle between the two Bridges—he told me that if one
      ate the root in the month of Thoth—that is August, one escaped sore eyes for a twelvemonth.
      That is right also, the scarlet anemone, it betokens the flame of love—and that evergreen its
      continuance. The centaury—that is the herb of union, it will close a wound so as
      not to show even a scar—and in marriage, no better symbol than that. What have
      you here? The lysimachia, that gives harmony and agreement of mind. They
      say that a plant of it fastened to the pole of a chariot will make the wildest and most
      impatient horses pull together. And the herb of the Twelve Gods! quite right, always remember
      the gods, they come in useful. The vervain—of course, it will give you all you will. But, ye
      Gods of Olympus! What have you done to pluck cypress! My dear Domitia, are you mad? Thyme,
      mint, if you will—but cypress! the tree of the infernal gods, and—as the Gods love me! let me
      look at your hands! They are red—what have you plucked—plucked till your hands are dyed—the
       androsœmum! Oh! Domitia! ill-fated child—look, look at your hands, the
      juice has stained them, they are dipped in blood.” 
 At the earliest rays of dawn the auguries were taken, not as of old by the flight of birds,
      but by inspection of the liver and heart of a sheep, that was slaughtered for the purpose by
      the Aruspices, and this done they came to the palace of Duilia, bearing the skin of the sheep,
      to announce that the portents were favorable, in fact, were of extraordinarily good promise. 
 “That is as I hoped,” said Longa Duilia, “and that will counteract and bring to naught the
      disastrous tokens of the wreath. Why, by Venus’s girdle, the girl has not been able to get her
      hands white yet. The stain of that nefast herb is on them still. But—ah! here she comes in her
      flame-colored veil. By the Body of Bacchus! after all it means no ill, for do not her hands
      agree in hue with her head-gear?”
     
 Domitia had laid aside her maidenly dress, the toga prætextata woven
      with horizontal stripes, for the dress of a married woman, the toga recta,
      with vertical stripes. About her waist was a woollen girdle fastened in a peculiar manner,
      with the so-called knot of Hercules, that was regarded as a charm against the evil eye, and
      was also employed in binding up wounds and fractured bones. The girl’s dress, as well as a net
      of red silk
      threads in which her hair had been tied up on the previous day, had been offered
      on the altars of the ancestral deities worshipped in the house. 
 Her hair had been divided that morning, not by a comb, but by the head of a lance, into six
      tresses that were plaited with colored ribbons. And about her head, beneath the veil, was the
      virgin’s wreath woven out of the flowers she had herself picked—but the ill-omened cypress and
      the blood distilling androsœmum had been omitted.
     
 And now with pipes and cymbals came the bridegroom attended by all his friends, to fetch
      the bride home. The house door was decorated with laurels, and incense smoked on the domestic
      altars, in the vestibule, and in the atrium. The boxes that contained the ancestral wax masks
      were open, and each face was wreathed about with flowers. Green lines connecting the boxes
      united all to one trunk forming a family tree. The household gods were not ignored, lamps
      burned before them, flowers adorned their heads, and cakes and wine were placed on shelves
      below them. 
 Slaves ran to and fro, and ran against each other. Ten witnesses, kinsmen of the bride and
      bridegroom, assembled to take cognizance of the marriage contract. Two seats were introduced
      into the hall, and the legs bound together, and over both was spread the skin of the sheep
      slaughtered that morning for the auspices. 
 Then bride and bridegroom were seated on these stools, the marriage contract was read
      aloud, and they received the salutations of their friends. The
      pronuba, a married female relative united their hands, and that
      accomplished, the bridegroom rose, and attended by the friends and kinsfolk of both parties,
      departed for
      the Temple of Jupiter, where the flamen Dialis offered sacrifice to the gods of
      marriage, to Jupiter, Juno, Tellus, and the old Latin half-forgotten deities of Picumnus and
      Pilumnus. 
 Whilst the sacred sacrifice was being performed, in the house of the bride all was being
      made ready for the wedding or meal after midday. 
 The bride was now esteemed to have passed out of the family of her father into that of her
      husband, his gods would be her gods, his house her house, his name hers. In signification of
      this the formula was used by her, “Since thou art Caius, I am Caia.” At a remote period it
      would have been “Since thou art Lucius I am Lucia,” and she would have lost her name of
      Domitia. But this was no longer customary, only the liturgical form of surrender was employed. 
 It was past noon when the procession returned, swelled by more friends and by all
      well-wishers, and as it entered the house, with a shiver Domitia observed the glowing face and
      water-blue eyes of the young prince, attended by his lictors. She caught his glance, but he
      dropped his eyes the moment they encountered hers, and she saw his cheeks pucker, as though
      with laughter. But she had no time to give thought to him; she was required to acknowledge the
      felicitations of the visitors, and to entreat them to partake of the hospitality of the hour,
      and to offer a pinch of incense and a libation to her happiness. 
 The supper was lengthy—many partook and came in relays, so that the entire afternoon was
      consumed by it. To the relief of Domitia, the prince Domitian had withdrawn. As each left the
      table he saluted the bride with the exclamation, Feliciter. 
 For this long and tedious ceremonial feast, she was allowed to rest on a couch, next to her
      husband, at the table, in the place of honor. 
 The meal lasted till evening, and then there ensued a movement. 
 The household goods of the bride, her spindle and distaff, her chest containing robes, were
      brought forth, and placed on biers to be conveyed to the new house. 
 Then Domitia rose, with tears in her eyes, and went to the several chambers she had
      occupied, to say farewell to the kitchen, to salute the hearth, to the shelf that served as
      chapel, to bid farewell to the ancestral gods, to the wax forefathers in the hall, then to
      kiss her mother, finally to turn, kneel and embrace the doorposts of the paternal dwelling,
      and kiss the threshold from which she parted. 
 Without, the procession waited. She was gently disengaged from her mother’s arms, and to
      the cries of Talasse! amidst a shower of walnuts thrown among the boys by
      the bridegroom, the procession started. 
 Domitia was attended by three lads, one went before carrying a torch, the other two walked,
      one on each side, carrying spindle and distaff. The torch, according to rule, was of
      whitethorn wood, and on arrival at the house of the bridegroom would be scrambled for and
      ripped to pieces by the guests, as every shred was esteemed to carry good luck. 
 Now rose a burst of song, the so-called Fescennian lays, some old and some new, accompanied
      by the flutes of musicians and the clash of castanets and cymbals of dancing girls. 
 The procession descended the hill to the Forum, crowds lining the way and shouting
       Feliciter! 
 At a corner there was a little clearing, for there lay a pallet, and on it a sick woman,
      who had been brought from her dwelling to see the sight. She extended and waved her hand,
      holding something as Domitia approached, and the bride through her tears noticed her, halted,
      went towards her, and said:— 
 “Glyceria! you here to wish me happiness!” 
 “And to give thee, dear lady, a little present.” 
 She extended to her a small amulet, that Domitia accepted gratefully, and stooping kissed
      the paralyzed woman on the brow. 
 An unheard-of thing! unparalleled! A thing she would not have done, had she been in full
      control over herself—a thing she would not have done, had not her heart brimmed with love for
      all, at that moment. She, a noble lady, belonging to one of the greatest houses in Rome,
      kissed a poor actor’s wife, an enfranchised slave—and that before all eyes. 
 About Glyceria was a dense throng of men and women and children, the occupants of the
      “Island” in which she lived. It was they, who, pitying her sufferings, desirous that she
      should see the procession, had opened a space before her, and held it open, that none might
      impede a full view of the marriage train. 
 And this throng of rude artisans, shoemakers, cordwainers, leather-sellers, hawkers and
      their wives and children saw this act of Domitia. For a moment they were silent, and then they
      broke into a roar of “Feliciter! feliciter! the Gods be with thee, dear lady! The Gods protect
      thee! The Gods shower blessings on thee!” 
 But Domitia might not tarry; confused, half ashamed of what she had done, half carried off
      her feet by the thrill of joy that went from the crowd to her, she advanced. 
 The train descended by the lake of Nero, now occupied by the Colosseum, then ascended the
      Celian Hill to the house of Lamia. 
 On reaching his door, the procession spread out, and gave space for the bride to advance. 
 Modestly, trembling with love, timidity, hope in her heart, she anointed the doorposts with
      oil and then passed woollen strings round them. 
 This accomplished, two young men started forward, caught her up, made a seat for her of
      their hands, and bore her over the threshold, which she might not touch with her feet, lest by
      accident or nervousness she should stumble, and so her entry into the new house be ill-omened.
      On being admitted into the habitation of her husband, it was her duty to go to the hearth and
      make up the fire, then to the fountain and draw water; next to worship the household gods. 
 The house was pretty. It had been fresh painted, and was bright with color, and sweet with
      flowers, for every pillar was wreathed and each door garlanded. Numerous lamps illumined the
      chambers, and in the atrium were reflected in the water tank. The air was vibrating with
      music, as choirs sang Fescennian songs, and timbrels tinkled and pipes twittered. 
 Domitia was received by the wife of L. Ælius Lamia, who had adopted Domitia’s husband. He
      was a quiet man, who had no ambition, had taken no offices, and had passed his time in taming
      birds. He was the son of a better known man, who had been a friend of Horace. 
 The old woman, gentle in manner, took Domitia by the hand and led her into the tablinum,
      where was old Lamia, a cripple through gout, and he kissed the girl, patted her hands and
      spoke an affectionate welcome. 
 “Claudia and I,” said he, “were childless and so we adopted Lucius. He has been a good son
      to us, and this is a happy day to all three,—to him who has secured the sweetest flower of
      Rome, and to Claudia and me who obtain so good a daughter. But, ah! we are old and have our
      humors, I, with my gout, am liable to be peevish. You must bear with our infirmities. You will
      have a worthy husband, one cut out of the old rock of which were the ancient Romans, and not
      of the Tiberine mud of which the present generation are moulded.” 
 “Come now,” said the old woman, “the guests are about to depart, bid them farewell.” 
 Then she led the young girl back into the atrium. 
 There stood the Chaldæan, dark, stern, ominous. 
 Domitia in exuberant joy smiled at him, and said: 
 “Elymas! You see my happiness. Isis has for once been in error—we, my Lamia and I, are
      united, and there have been no hands thrust forth to part us.” 
 “My lady,” said the astrologer, “the day is not yet over.” 
 “And the auguries were all propitious.” 
 “The promise of the augurs may not jump with thy desire,” he replied. 
 She had no time for more words, as her hand was caught by L. Ælius Lamia, who drew her
      aside into the lararium or chapel. 
 “My dearest,” he said, “this is a day of trial to thee—but we shall be left undisturbed
      shortly. The guests depart and the riot will cease.” 
 She looked at him, with eyes that brimmed with tears, and a sob relieved her heart, as she
      cast herself on his breast and said:— 
 “Quoniam tu Caius, ego Caia.” 
 A rumor, none knew from whom it arose, spread rapidly in whispers, sending a quiver of
      alarm, distress, pity, through the entire wedding party, reaching last of all him most
      concerned. 
 None dared breathe in his ear what all feared; but none would separate till it was surely
      ascertained whether what was surmised was a fact or not. 
 The slaves knew it and looked wistfully at Lamia. 
 He was engaged in making trifling presents to the many guests and well-wishers, moving from
      one to another, attended by slaves with trays piled up with gifts. 
 Eboracus burst on him, through the throng, forgetting, in his agitation and fear, the
      diffidence that belonged to his position. 
 “Sir! Where is the mistress?” 
 Lamia, without looking at him, or desisting from what he was about, answered: 
 “Within, being freed from her veil and bridal ornaments.” 
 “Sir! Lucius! she has been stolen from you! she has been carried away.” 
 Lamia stood as one petrified. 
 “How dare you utter such a jest?” 
 “It is no jest—she has been conveyed hence. She is not in your house.” 
 Without another word, Lamia flew into the portion of the house to which Domitia had
      retired. 
 There all was in confusion. The female slaves were either struck down with terror, or
      crying out that they were not to blame. 
 “Where is she?” asked Lamia, hardly realizing that there was actual loss, thinking this was
      some frolic of his young companions, who on such occasions allowed themselves great licence. 
 To add to the confusion, a tame magpie with clipped wing, belonging to the gouty old Lamia,
      got in the way of every one, and screamed when run over; and the elder man roared out reproach
      and brandished his crutch when the life of his pet was endangered. 
 Claudia, like a pious woman, had rushed to the lararium to supplicate
      the assistance of the Gods, especially of Lamius, son of Hercules and Omphale, the reputed
      half-divine ancestor of the family. 
 Domitia had disappeared.—How?—none could say. She had been spirited away, one said in this
      manner, another said in that. One held it as his opinion that she had been carried off by some
      disbanded Vitellian soldiers who were said to lurk about the suburbs of Rome and commit
      depredations. Some thought that in maiden shyness she had fled home; some whispered that the
      Gods had translated her; others that a former lover had suborned the servants to admit him,
      and that he had conveyed her from her husband’s house to his own. 
 But in what direction had she been taken? There again opinions differed, and tongues gave
      conflicting
      accounts. One had seen a litter hurried down the Clivus Scauri. One
      declared that he had seen a girl running in the direction of Nero’s lake, and suggested that
      this was Domitia who had gone thither to destroy herself. One had noticed suspicious-looking
      men wrapped in military cloaks lounging about, and these had disappeared—he had even seen the
      backs of some near the Porta Metrovia. Then one cried out:— 
 “What else can be expected when such an ill-omened bird is kept in the house, as a magpie?” 
 Not until all guests, visitors, had been excluded from the house, could anything be learned
      with certainty, and that was little. During the afternoon, shortly before the arrival of the
      procession, several male and female slaves had arrived under the direction of a Chaldæan
      soothsayer, who announced that he had been sent along with them to the house of the bridegroom
      by the bride’s mother, the Lady Duilia, and that they formed a portion of Domitia’s
      attendance, who had been associated with her in her former home, and would be about her person
      in her new quarters. No suspicion had been roused, and as the Magian spoke with authority, and
      gave directions, which it was presumed he was commissioned to do, and as old Lamia was
      crippled with gout and moreover indisposed to attend to such matters, and the old lady was
      simple to childishness, these strangers were suffered to do much what they pleased; and on the
      bride retiring to be divested of the flame colored veil, her wreath and other ornaments, had
      been allowed to take possession of her. 
 What happened further they did not know. In the excitement of the arrival of visitors
      nothing had been
      observed till some of the household servants remarked that the servants of the
      family of Duilia had left,—that there had been a bustle in the garden court, and that a litter
      had departed, borne by men who ran under their load. But even then no notion that the bride
      had been carried off was entertained. For some time no suspicion of mischief arose. When the
      slaves became aware that their new mistress was no longer in the house, there was first some
      surprise entertained that she was not seen, then a notion that she might be unwell or
      over-tired—but the first word that suggested that she had been conveyed away came from without
      the house, from a guest who inquired casually what lady had left the house, in a litter, borne
      by trotting porters. Lamia, in violent agitation, at once hurried to the house whence Domitia
      had come, to ask for an explanation. There he learned nothing satisfactory. No
      servants had been sent beforehand. Domitia had taken with her two female slaves, but they had
      attended her in the procession. The sorcerer, it was true, had disappeared and had not
      returned. 
 Lamia was obliged to return home, without his anxiety being in any way removed. 
 On reaching his palace on the Cœlian, he learned something further. In the room in which
      Domitia had been divested of her bridal ornaments, which lay scattered in disorder, was a
      crystal cup that contained the dregs of wine, and this wine was drugged with a powerful
      narcotic. Of this the slave who acted as house-surgeon and physician was certain. He had
      tasted it and detected the presence of an opiate. Nothing further could be learned, neither
      whence came the strange slaves nor whither they had gone. 
 In the mean time a party surrounding a closed litter had passed through the Porta Capena,
      and was hurrying along the Appian Way. 
 Directly the city was left, a tall man who directed the convoy called a halt;—then
      approaching the litter, he drew back the curtains, and said:— 
 “Asleep! Two of you take her up, lift her, set her on her feet and rouse her.” 
 He was obeyed and a helpless body was removed, sustained between two stout slaves, and made
      to stand on the causeway. 
 “Shake her,” said the director, who was none other than the Chaldæan. “If she sleep on, she
      will never wake. Roused and made to walk she must be. We need fear no pursuit. I have left
      those behind who will spread a false rumor, and send such as think she has been carried away
      along the wrong road. Make her walk.” 
 The helpless girl—it was Domitia—staggered with drowsiness and stumbled. 
 “Let me sleep,” she murmured. 
 “It must not be, lady. To let you sleep is to consign you to death. You must be constrained
      to walk.” 
 “Let me sleep!” she fretfully said. 
 “If you sleep you die.” 
 “I want to die—only to sleep. I am dead weary.” 
 “Make her move along,” said the sorcerer in a low tone, and the slaves who held her up drew
      her forward. She scarce moved her feet. 
 “Oh, you are cruel. I want to sleep. An hour! half an hour. For one moment longer!” she
      pleaded. 
 Still the bearers drew her forward, they did not lift
      her so that she need not move her feet. She was constrained to step forward. 
 “I pray you! I will give you gold. You shall have all my jewels. Lay me down. Let go your
      hold, and I will lie where I am, and sleep.” 
 “Draw her further.—Hark! here come horses. Aside! behind that tomb!” 
 The party stole from off the road and secreted itself behind one of the mausoleums that
      line the sides of the Appian Way. 
 “Shake her—lest she doze off in your arms,” said Elymas, and the slaves obeyed. 
 Then Domitia began to sob. “Have pity! only for a little while, I am so tired. The day has
      been so long and so wearying.” 
 “They are passed—mere travellers,” said the sorcerer. “Into the road again. Force her to
      walk.” 
 Then she called, “Lamia—my Lucius! come to me, drive these men away. They will not let me
      sleep,” and she struggled to free herself, and unable to do so by a spasmodic effort, began to
      sob, and sobbed herself into a half doze. 
 “She is sleeping. Run with her,” called the Magus. 
 In vain did she weep, entreat, threaten, naught availed, she was forced to advance; now to
      take a few steps, to rest on her feet, to walk in actuality. The very anger she felt at not
      being allowed to cast herself down, fold her hands under her head, and drop off into
      unconsciousness, tended to rouse her. 
 After about half an hour, her entreaties to be allowed to rest became less frequent, and
      alternated with inquiries as to where she was, whither she was going, why she was forced to
      walk, and that at night.
      Then she ceased altogether to complain of drowsiness, and finding she met with no
      response to her inquiries as to her destination, she became silent; she was now conscious, but
      her brain was clouded, perplexed. She could remember nothing that would account for her
      present position. Whether she were in a dream, laboring under nightmare, she could not tell,
      and purposely she struck her foot against one of the paving blocks of lava, and by the pain
      assured herself that she was actually awake. 
 But where was she? 
 She looked up. The sky was besprent with stars, a sky limpid, tender, vaporless and vast,
      out of which the stars throbbed with iridescent light in all the changeful flicker of topaz,
      emerald and ruby. And the air was full of flying stars, in tens of thousands, they settled on
      rushes by the roadside in chains of fire, they flashed across the eyes, they settled down on
      the dress; and out of the cool grass shone the steady lustre of innumerable glow-worms. 
 The milky way, like an illumined veil, crossed the vault, vaporous, transparent with stars
      shining through it. 
 From the black monuments on each side hooted the owls, bats swept by, diving out of night
      to brush by the passers along the road and plunge back into night, like old forgotten fancies
      of the dreaming mind, that recur and vanish again, in waking hours. Out of the grass the
      crickets shrilled, and frogs called with flutelike tones at intervals, whilst others
      maintained an incessant chatter. 
 Where was she? What were these great fantastic edifices on each side of the road? They were
      no
      houses, for out of none glimmered a light. No occupants stood in the doors, or
      sang and piped on the threshold. These were no taverns, for no host invited to rest within,
      and praised his fare. The road was forsaken, still as death, and these mansions were the
      dwellings of the dead. She knew this now—that she was on one of the roads that led from the
      gates of Rome, lined with tombs. How she had got there she knew not. Least of all did she know
      for what reason she was being dragged along it. She had thus trudged for a considerable time;
      she had ceased to speak. She was occupied with her thoughts. Weary she was, but in too great
      anguish of mind to be aware how weary she was, till tripping on a stone she fell. 
 Then a voice said:— 
 “She is full awake now. There is naught to fear. Let her again mount the litter.” 
 “Elymas!” exclaimed the girl, “I know you, I know your voice. What means this? Whither am I
      being taken?” 
 “Madam,” said the sorcerer in reply, after a pause, “your own eyes shall answer the
      question better than my lips, to-morrow.” 
 Sleep-drunk, with clouded brain, eyes that saw as in a dream, feet that moved
      involuntarily, Domitia descended from the litter and tottered in at a doorway when informed
      that she had reached her destination. 
 Where that was she did not care, whose house this was mattered nothing to her in her then
      condition of weariness. 
 Female slaves bearing lights received her and directed her steps to a chamber where they
      would have divested her of her garments and put her to bed, had she not refused their
      assistance, thrown herself on the couch and in a moment fallen fast asleep. 
 The slaves looked at each other, whispered, and resolved not to torment by rousing her;
      they accordingly drew the heavy curtains of the doorway and left her to her slumbers. 
 But weary though Domitia was, her sleep was not dreamless, the song of a thousand
      nightingales that made the night musical reached her ears and penetrated the doorways of her
      troubled brain and wove fantasies; the ever-present sense of fear, not dissipated by slumber,
      weighed on her and gave sombre color to her dreams; the motion of the palanquin had
      communicated itself in her fancy, to the bed, and that
      tossed and swayed under her. Her weary feet seemed stung and burnt as though they
      had been held too close to the fire. Now she saw Lamia’s face, and then it was withdrawn; now
      her mother seemed to be calling to her from an ever-increasing distance. 
 Yet troubled though her sleep was, it afforded her brain some rest, and she woke in the
      morning at a later hour than usual, when by the strip of warm light below the curtains she was
      made aware that the sun had risen. 
 She started from sleep, passed her hand across her face, pressed her brows, stepped to the
      doorway, pushed the curtains aside and looked out into a little atrium, in which plashed a
      fountain, and where stood boxes of myrtles in full flower, steeping the atmosphere with
      fragrance. 
 At once two female servants came to her, bowed low and desired permission to assist in
      dressing her. 
 With some hesitation she consented. 
 “Where am I?” she asked. 
 “By the lake of Alba,” answered a dark-faced servant with hard lustrous eyes, and in a
      foreign dialect. 
 “In whose house?” 
 The slaves looked at each other, and made no reply. 
 Again she put the question. 
 “Lady, we are forbidden to say,” answered one of the slaves. 
 “At Alba?” muttered Domitia. 
 Then, as the woman divested her of her tunic, something fell from her bosom on the mosaic
      floor. The maid stooped, picked it up and handed it to Domitia, who turned it in her palm and
      looked at it, at first without comprehension. Then she recollected what
      this was—the amulet given her by Glyceria. It was a red cornelian fish pierced at
      one end and a fine gold ring inserted in the hole, so that the stone might be suspended. 
 Domitia was not in a condition of mind to pay attention to the ornament, but she bade one
      of the servants thread a piece of silk through the ring that she might wear the amulet about
      her neck, and then she allowed herself to be conducted to the bath. 
 With suspicious eyes the girl observed everything. She was obviously in a country villa
      belonging to some Roman noble, and that villa beside the Alban Lake. 
 The Ælii Lamiæ had no country-house at this place, of that she was aware. She had heard
      some of the friends of her mother speak of the beauties of the Alban Lake, and then her mother
      had lamented that the family estate lay by the Gabian puddle. But she could not recall that
      any one of them had a villa there. 
 When she left the bath she walked out of the doorway through the vestibule and stood on the
      terrace. 
 Below was the sombre lake, almost circular, with the rolling woods of oak and beech flowing
      down the slopes to the very water’s edge, here and there the green covering interrupted by
      precipitous crags of tuffa. Yonder was the great ridge on which gleamed white the Temple of
      Jupiter Latiaris, the central shrine of the Latin races, the great pilgrimage place to which
      the country people turned in every distress. 
 She had not previously seen the Alban Lake, although Gabii had been her residence for some
      months, and that was seated on a low spur of the mountains, in the crater of one of which
      slept this tranquil and lovely sheet of water. But she knew enough about it by
      hearsay to be sure that she was not misinformed by the slaves as to where she now
      was. She certainly was beside that lake, near which once stretched Alba Longa, the cradle of
      the Roman race—a race of shepherds driven from its first seat by volcanic fires, to settle
      beside the Tiber on the Palatine Hill. 
 That road along which she had been conveyed during the night was the great Appian Way. It
      could have been none other, and that led, as she was aware, along the spurs of the Alban
      mountains. 
 She walked the terrace, her brow moist with anxious thought. 
 Why had she been carried off? 
 By whom had she been swept as by a hurricane from her husband’s side? 
 A sense of numbness was on her brain still, caused by the shock. To Lucius Lamia her heart
      had turned with the reverence she had borne to her father, with the sweetness and glow of
      girlish love for one who would be linked with her by a still nearer tie. She could not realize
      that she was parted from Lamia finally, irrevocably. She was in a waking dream: a dream of
      great horror, but yet a dream that would roll away and reality would return. She would wake
      from it in the arms of her dear husband, looking into his eyes, clinging to his heart, hearing
      his words soothing her mind, allaying her terrors. 
 If at this time she could have conceived that to be possible which nevertheless was to take
      place, she would have run to the lake and plunged into its blue waters. 
 Singularly enough no thought of the vision in the temple of Isis recurred to her. Possibly
      she was in too
      stunned a condition of mind; possibly the effects of the narcotic still hung
      about her, like the vapors that trail along the landscape after a storm of rain at the break
      of the weather. No thought of hers connected this outrage with Domitian. This was due to the
      impression produced in her by conversation with her mother, who, she believed, was designing
      to secure Domitian for herself. 
 Moreover, the young prince had never shown her any favor. He had studiously neglected her,
      that he might address himself to Duilia. He had taunted her, sneered at her, but never spoken
      to her words that might be construed as a declaration of love. She recalled how she had urged
      her mother to expel him from the house when he sought refuge there; how she had sought to
      thrust him forth to certain death, to deny him the rights of hospitality. Such was enough to
      provoke resentment, not to awaken love. Her mother, on the other hand, had bound him to her by
      the tie of gratitude, for she had saved him at that time of extreme peril. 
 Seeing the dark slave girl, Domitia signed to her to approach, and asked: 
 “Where are some of my family? Is not Euphrosyne here—or Eboracus?” 
 “Lady—none came with you save the servants of our master.” 
 “And he?” 
 “Madam, I may not say.” 
 “There is that Magus, Elymas; send him to me.” 
 After some delay the sorcerer appeared, and approached, bowed and stood silent with hands
      crossed on his breast. 
 “Elymas,” said Domitia, “I require you to enlighten me. What is the meaning of this? Why
      have I been carried away to Albanum? By whose orders has this been done?” 
 He bowed again—paused, and then, with obvious uneasiness in his manner replied:— 
 “Destiny will be fulfilled.” 
 “What mean you? Destiny! some drive it before them as a wheelbarrow, and such seem you to
      be. Why am I here and not in Lamia’s house in Rome?” 
 “Did you not, lady, behold in vision that which was to be?” 
 She started, lost color and shivered. 
 “What mean you?” 
 “The purple.” 
 “The purple! I desire no purple. You speak enigmatically. You have acted a treacherous part
      in forwarding this act of violence. I have been snatched from my dear husband’s side, the Gods
      who gave me to him have been outraged, I—I, a member of a noble house, a daughter of Domitius
      Corbulo, have been treated as though the prey of a party of slave-hunters. What next? Am I to
      be taken into the market-place, and sold by auction? Or am I carried off by freebooters—to be
      let go for a price? Name me the captain of this robber band, and the price at which I may be
      ransomed. I promise it shall be paid. But that condign chastisement be inflicted for this
      insult, that I will also guarantee. I thank the Gods, Rome is not on the confines of the
      world, that these deeds can be perpetrated with impunity. We are not at Nizibis or Edessa to
      be fallen upon by Parthians, or held to ransom by Armenians——” 
 “Young lady,” said the Magian, “your words are high-sounding, but your threats are such as
      cannot be executed, nor is any price asked for your redemption. When you set your foot on the
      Clivus Scauri, it is a narrow way, between high walls—and there is no option, you must go on.
      You cannot turn aside to right or left.” 
 “I can turn back.” 
 “The way is broken up behind. You must go forward.” 
 “Whither?” 
 “Look!” 
 A number of male slaves came forth from the villa; they were in white. 
 “Do you know that livery?” asked the sorcerer. 
 Then Domitia uttered a cry of despair, and threw herself on the ground. Now she did know
      where she was, in whose power she was, and how hopeless it was for her to expect to escape. 
 The white was the Imperial livery. 
 Two days passed, and Domitia remained undisturbed. No tidings reached her from Rome, but to
      her great relief the Cæsar Domitian did not appear. That a meeting with him must take place,
      she was aware, but in what manner he would address her, that she could not guess; whether he
      would take occasion to exhibit ignoble revenge for her treatment of him on the night when he
      sought refuge in her house, or whether he would approach her as a lover. This the sequel could
      alone disclose. The second alternative was what she mainly dreaded. 
 On the third day, hearing a bustle in the hall, and conjecturing that some one had arrived,
      and that the critical moment had come, Domitia waited in her chamber with beating heart, and
      long-drawn sighs. When the curtains were sharply withdrawn, to her surprise and delight her
      mother entered, radiant in her best toilette, her face, as far as could be judged through the
      paint, wreathed with smiles. 
 “Well!” said she.—“But first a seat. You sly fox! who would have thought it? But there—I am
      content. I have sent out no invitations to a little supper, there is now no occasion for it,
      and one does not care to spend—without an expectation of it leading to results. To look at
      your face no one would have supposed that
      depth in you—and to play us all such a trick, poor Lamia and me. It would really
      make a widow of a week old laugh. Don’t smother me, my dear, and above all, don’t cry—that is
      to say, if you cry do not let your tears fall on my cheek, you know I am—well—well—it might
      spoil my complexion.” 
 “Mother,” gasped the unhappy girl—“O, how can you speak to me in this manner. You know, you
      must know, I have been carried away against my will. O mother, Lucius does not suppose that——” 
 “My dear child, it does not concern me in the least, whether the kitten carried off the
      rat, or the rat the kitten. Here you are in the rat’s hole, and all you have to look to is to
      eat your rat and not let the rat eat you.” 
 “Oh, mother! mother! take me home with you.” 
 “Domitia, do not be a baby. Of course you cannot return. You have bidden farewell to the
      household Gods, and renounced the paternal threshold.” 
 “Mother—I have embraced the gate-posts of the Lamiæ.” 
 “But the Gods of that family have been unable or unwilling to retain you, they have
      resigned you to—I cannot say, in conscience, nobler hands, for the Flavian family—well, we
      know what we know,—but to more powerful hands, that will not let you go. Besides, my dear, I
      have no wish to have you home again. When a bird has flown, it has said farewell to the nest,
      to its cracked eggshells and worms, and must find another.” 
 “Do not be cruel!” 
 “I am not cruel—but what has happened must be accepted, that is the true philosophy of
      life, better than all that nonsense declaimed by philosophers.” 
 “Mother! I will not stay here.” 
 “Domitia, here you must stay till somebody comes to take you away. Why! as the Gods love
      me! I expect yet to hear you proclaimed Augusta, and to have to offer incense and to pour a
      libation on your altar. Think—what an honor to have your wax head among the ancestors, as a
      divinity to be worshipped—but no—I am wrong there, you would be in the
       lararium, or set up in the vestibule, a deified ancestress or member of
      the family is exalted from the atrium to the temple. I really will go out of my way and have a
      little supper to honor the occasion. I see it all—we shall before long have a college of
      Flavian priests, and all the whole bundle of mouldy old usurers, and tax-collectors, and their
      frowsy womankind will be gods, with temples and a cult, and you, my dear! It makes my mouth
      water.” 
 “But, mother, why am I carried away?” 
 “Why! O you jocose little creature, why? because some person I know of has taken a
      fancy to your monkey ways and baby face.” 
 “I belong to Lamia. I have been married to him.” 
 “Oh! that is easily settled. I thank the Immortals, divorce is easily obtained in Rome—with
      money, influence in Rome—to the end of time, my dear.” 
 “I do not desire to be divorced—I will not be divorced. I love Lucius and he loves me.” 
 “You are a child—just away from your dolls, and know nothing of life.” 
 “But, mother, there are laws. I will throw myself on the protection of the Senate.” 
 Longa Duilia laughed aloud. “Silly fool! laws bind the subjects and the weak, not princes
      and the strong.
      Make your mind up to accept what has happened. It is the work of destiny.” 
 “It is an infamous crime.” 
 “My child, do not use such words, what might be crime among common folk is pleasantry among
      princes. They all do it. It is their right. It is of no avail your attempting resistance.
      Domitian has taken a fancy to you—he is young, good-looking, Cæsar, all sorts of honors have
      been heaped on him, and he has but to put out a rake and comb together all the good in the
      world. And”—she drew nearer to her daughter,—“he may be Emperor some day. Titus has but one
      lumpy, ugly girl—no son.” 
 “I care not. I hate him! let me go back to Lamia!” 
 “That is impossible.” 
 “Not if I will!” 
 “You cannot. You would be stayed by the servants here.” 
 “But you—cannot you help me? O mother, if you have any love for me! For the sake of my
      dear, dear father!” 
 “Even if I would, I could not. Why, there is not a court in Rome, not the Senate even can
      afford you protection and release. The Flavians are up now.” 
 “I will appeal to Vespasian, to the Emperor!” 
 “He is in Egypt.” 
 The girl panted and beat her head with her hands. 
 “Lamia! he shall release me.” 
 “He needs some one to release him.” 
 “How so?” 
 “He insulted Domitian in the Senate House—all because of you, and is under arrest. For less
      matters, than what he has done, lives have been lost.” 
 “He will never—no, never!” she could not finish her sentence, her heart was boiling over,
      and she burst into a paroxysm of sobs. 
 “The Gods! the Gods help me!” she cried. 
 “My dear Domitia, you might as well call on the walls to assist you. The Gods! They are
      just as bad as mortals. You may cry, but they will look between their fingers, accept your
      prayers and offerings and laugh at you as a fool. Why, as the Gods love me! Does not the
      family derive from Lamius, and was not he the child of Hercules and Omphale? It was very
      naughty and shocking, and all that sort of thing—but they all do it, and are not in the least
      disposed to assist you. On the contrary, they will back up the ravisher.” 
 “Then I have no help—save in myself. I will never be his.” 
 “Be advised by me, you foolish child. When you come under a cherry tree you pluck all the
      ripe fruit; and what you cannot eat yourself you give to your friends. Do you not perceive
      that having been fortunate enough to catch the fancy of the young Cæsar, you can use this
      fancy and make large profit out of it? He is already very freely distributing offices to all
      his friends and such as most grossly flatter him. What may not you obtain for me! That is if I
      take a liking for any one and wish to marry him, you must positively obtain the proconsulship
      of Syria or Egypt for him. And as to Lamia, he can be choked off with a prætorship.” 
 The veil was plucked aside, and Domitian entered. 
 Longa Duilia rose; not so Domitia Longina. 
 He stood for a moment looking at the girl. 
 “Saucy still?” he said. 
 “Wrathful at this treatment,” she answered, with her eyes on the ground, and her hands
      clasped. “Because I would have denied to you a suppliant, the hospitality of our house, must
      I, unsoliciting it, be forced to accept yours?” 
 “Domitia, has your mother informed you what I have designed for you?” 
 “I should prefer that you concerned yourself with your prætorial duties.” 
 Domitian bit his lip. He had been invested with the office of prætor of the city, but in
      his overweening conceit deemed it unworthy of him to discharge the duties of the office. 
 “It is my intent, Domitia, to elevate you into the Flavian family.” 
 “O how gracious!” sneered the girl,—“taken up like Trygdeus.” 
 “Domitia!” exclaimed her mother, then at once perceiving that the allusion was lost on the
      uneducated prince, she said:— 
 “Quite so, on the wings of the Bird of Jove.”
     
 The young man became crimson. He was convinced that there was some bitter sneer in the
      words of Domitia, and he was ashamed at his inability to comprehend the allusion. 
 “What I intend for you,” said he, moving from the doorway to where he could observe her
      face, “what I intend for you is what there is not another woman in Rome who would not give her
      jewels to obtain.” 
 “Then I pray you address yourself to them. Pay
      your debts with their subscriptions, and leave me who am content to be
      disregarded, in the tranquillity I so love—with my husband, Ælius Lamia.” 
 “Lamia!” laughed Domitian. “You are to be divorced from him. Your mother is willing.” 
 “My mother has no more power over me. I am out of the paternal family.” 
 “You will consent yourself.” 
 “Who will make me?” 
 “That will I. It is easy to rend apart——” 
 “Any fool can break, not all can bind.” 
 “Domitia, be advised and do not incense me.” 
 “I care not for myself. I have but one wish. Let me go. Take, if you will, what is my
      property, take that of Lamia, but let us retire together to some little farm and be quiet
      there, drive us, if you will, out of Italy—but do not separate us.” 
 “You talk at random. Follow me.” 
 He led the way, stood in the entrance, holding back the curtain, and Duilia drew her
      daughter from her seat. 
 “Come,—Lamia awaits you,” said Domitian. 
 Then the girl started to her feet. 
 “He is here! You will be generous,—like a prince!” 
 “Come with me.” 
 She now followed with beating heart. Her cheeks were flushed, a sparkle was in her eye, her
      breath came fast through her nostrils, her teeth were set. 
 Without were many lictors lining the way, filling the court. 
 He led into that portion of the villa where were the baths and entered the warm room. There
      Domitia saw at once Lamia, stripped almost to the skin, held
      by soldiers of the prince’s guard, his mouth gagged, and a surgeon standing by
      with a razor. 
 She would have sprung to him and thrown her arms around him, had she not been restrained. 
 “Domitia,” said the young Cæsar; “you will see how that to divorce you is in my power,
      unless you consent to it yourself, and give yourself to me.” 
 Domitia trembled in every limb. She looked with distended eyes at Lamia, who had no power
      to speak, save with his eyes, and they were fixed on her. 
 A large marble bath stood near, and both hot and cold water could be turned on into it. 
 She knew but too well what the threat was. Seneca had so perished under Nero,—by the
      cutting of the veins he had bled to death. 
 Petronius, master of the Revels to the same tyrant, had suffered in the same manner, and as
      his blood flowed he had mocked and hearkened to ribald verses till the power to listen and to
      flaunt his indifference were at an end. 
 And now the second Nero, not yet full blown, but giving earnest of what he would be, was
      threatening Lamia with the same death. It was not a gradual and painless extinction, but a
      death of great suffering, for it led to agonizing cramps, knotting the muscles, and
      contracting the limbs. Domitia knew this—she had heard the dying agonies of Seneca and
      Petronius described,—and she looked with quivering lips and bloodless cheeks on him whom she
      loved best—on the only one in the world she loved, threatened with the same awful death. 
 She would do anything short of taking the Cæsar Domitian as her husband in place of him to
      whom she
      was bound by the most sacred ties,—anything short of that to save the life of
      Lamia. 
 The struggle in her bosom was terrible; her head spun, she tried to speak but could frame
      no words. 
 She sought some guidance in Lamia’s eyes, but her own swam with tears, and she could not
      read what he would advise. 
 “My child,” said her mother, “of course it is all very sad, and that sort of thing—but it
      is and must be so. If a wilful girl will not be brought to reason in any other way—well, it is
      a pity.” 
 Domitian turned to Domitia. 
 “His life is in your power,” said he. “He has insulted me before the Conscript Fathers, and
      is under arrest. I have brought him hither—to die. But I give his life to you on the one
      condition that you allow divorce to be pronounced between you and him, and that in his place
      you accept me.” 
 Domitia turned her face away. 
 “So be it,” said he. “Surgeon, open his veins.” 
 With a slash of the razor across the arm at the fold, an artery was severed, and the black
      blood spurted forth. 
 Uttering a cry of horror, Domitia battled with those who held her, to reach and clasp her
      husband. 
 “Cut the other arm,” commanded the prince, “then cast him into the bath.” 
 “I yield,” gasped Domitia, burying her face in her hands and sinking to her knees. 
 “Then bind up his wound, and let him go!” 
 “Destiny must be fulfilled,” said Elymas who stood behind. “You were born for the purple.” 
 The dramatic composer has this great advantage over the novelist, that when he has to allow
      for a certain amount of time,—it may be for years—to elapse between the parts of his play, he
      lowers the curtain, the first or second act is concluded, ices, oranges are taken round in the
      stalls; the orchestra strikes up an overture, the gentlemen retire to the promenade gallery
      for a cigar, and the ladies discuss their acquaintances, and the toilette of those in the
      boxes, after having explored the theatre with their glasses. 
 At Munich and Bayreuth, at the performance of Wagner’s operas, the space allowed between
      the acts is sufficient for a walk and for a meal. Thus the lapse of time between the parts of
      a drama is given a real expression, and the minds of those who have followed the first part of
      the story are prepared to accept a change in the conditions of the performers, such as could
      be brought about solely by the passage of time. 
 But a novelist has no such assistance, he is not able to produce such an illusion; even
      when his story appears in a serial, he is without this advantage, for the movement of his
      tale, when it is rapid, is artificially delayed by the limitations laid down by the editors of
      the magazines, and the space allotted to him, and when
      he does require a pause to allow for the gliding away of a certain number of
      years, that pause consists of precisely the same number of days as intervened in the serial
      publication, between chapters in which the action should have been continuous. 
 The writer must, therefore, throw himself on the indulgence of the reader, and plead to be
      allowed like a Greek chorus to stand forward and narrate what has taken place, during a period
      of time concerning which he proposes to pass over without detailed account, before he resumes
      the thread of his narrative. 
 When Vespasian was hailed Emperor by the troops he was aged sixty-one, and none supposed
      that his reign would be long. He associated his eldest son Titus with him in government, but
      would not allow the younger, Domitian, any power. 
 When the Emperor reached the capital, he learned the misuse Domitian had made of that which
      he had arrogated to himself, or which had been granted to him by the Senate, in his father’s
      absence. The old Emperor was vastly displeased at the misconduct of his younger son, and would
      perhaps have dealt severely with him, had he not been dissuaded from so doing by Titus, who
      pointed out, that as he himself had no son, in all probability Domitian would at some time
      succeed to the purple. 
 The young man, kept in the background, not even allowed the command in any military
      expedition, carefully watched and restrained from giving vent to his natural disposition,
      chafed at his enforced inactivity, and at the marked manner in which he was set behind his
      elder brother, a man who, by the capture of Jerusalem, had gained a name, and had attached the sol
      diery to him. Domitian was known to the military only by his abortive attempt to
      pluck the laurels in Germany from the brow of his kinsman Cerealis, for the adornment of his
      own head. 
 Domitian was granted none of the titles that indicated association in the Empire. He was
      not suffered to take part in public affairs. His insolence in neglecting the duties of prætor
      of the city, as beneath his dignity, was punished in this manner. When Titus celebrated his
      triumph after the Jewish war, with unusual magnificence, he and his father rode in chariots of
      state, but Domitian was made to follow on horseback. When Vespasian and his eldest son showed
      themselves in public, they were carried on thrones, whereas Domitian was made to attend in the
      rear in a litter. 
 The envious, ambitious young prince, under this treatment was driven to wear a mask, and he
      affected a love of literature, and indifference to the affairs of state. Titus, who knew less
      of him than his father, was deceived, but Vespasian was too well aware of the radically evil
      heart of his younger son to trust him in any way. 
 Domitia was unable to escape from compulsary association with this imperial cub. Vespasian
      was unwilling to undo the past, and have the scandal raked up again, and public attention
      called to it. The minds of the volatile Romans had forgotten the circumstances and were
      occupied with new matters of gossip. Domitian married Domitia Longina, and the old Emperor
      after some consideration concluded that she should remain his wife. 
 But the relations between her and the prince were
      strained. She hated him for what he had done, and she made no attempt to affect a
      liking she did not feel. 
 Lamia remained unmarried; he had cared for no other woman, and he felt that there was not
      to be found one who could ever be to him what he had hoped Domitia would have proved. 
 Once Titus asked him his reason for not marrying. 
 “Why do you inquire?” said Lamia, with a bitter smile, “do you also wish to carry off my
      wife?” 
 On the death of the old Emperor, Titus succeeded without any difficulties being raised. His
      father had already associated him in the Empire and had gradually transferred the conduct of
      affairs to his hands. 
 Hitherto the brothers had lived on very good terms with each other, at all events in
      appearance, and Domitian had been sufficiently prudent to veil his jealousy of Titus, who had
      shown himself kindly disposed towards his younger brother. 
 On the accession of Titus, Domitian hoped to be associated with him in government in the
      same manner as Titus had been with his father. In this he was disappointed, his disappointment
      got the better of his prudence, and he declared that his brother had falsified the will of
      Vespasian, who had divided the power equally between them. 
 On the first day of his reign, Titus designated Domitian as his successor, but he allowed
      him no independent power; and the young prince at once involved himself in intrigues and
      sought to rouse the troops to revolt, and to proclaim him in place of Titus. 
 The condition of Domitia would have been more intolerable than it was, but that Vespasian,
      up to his
      death, retained his younger son about his person, in Rome, and it was but rarely
      that the prince was able to escape to his villa, at Albanum, where Domitia remained in
      seclusion. And his visits there were not only few and far between, but also brief. 
 He was in bad humor when there, at liberty to vent his irritation at the manner in which he
      was treated by his father, and the behavior towards him of Domitia was not calculated to
      dispel his vapors. 
 A considerable change had come over her face. The expression had altered; it had been full
      of sweetness, and the muscles had been flexible. Now it was hard-set and stern. 
 Domitian cursed her for the fascination she still exercised over him. It was perhaps her
      unyielding temper, her openly expressed scorn, and her biting sarcasms which stung him to
      maintain his grip on her, knowing that this was to her torture. Yet her beauty exercised over
      him a hold from which he could not escape. His feelings towards her were a mixture of
      passionate admiration and savage resentment. From every one else he met with adulation, or at
      least respect, from her neither. His will was a law to a legion of sycophants, to her it was
      something she seemed to find a pleasure in defying. 
 Domitia nursed her resentment, and this soured her nature and reflected itself in her
      features. 
 In the long Chiaramonte Gallery of the Vatican Museum is an exquisite and uninjured bust of
      Domitia Longina as a girl; the face is one that holds the passer-by, it is so sweet, so
      beautiful, so full of a glorious soul. 
 In the Florence Gallery is one of the same woman
      after Domitian had snatched her away from Lamia, and hidden her in his Alban
      villa. Lovely the face is still, but the beautiful soul has lost its light, the softness has
      gone out of the face, and the shadow of a darkened life broods over it. 
 At Albanum the solitary Domitia had the satisfaction of being attended by her servant
      Euphrosyne, and the faithful Eboracus was also allowed to be there as her minister. 
 She occasionally visited her mother in Rome, but the chasm between them widened. Duilia
      could not understand her daughter’s refusal to accept the inevitable and failure to lay hold
      of her opportunities, and, as she termed it, “eat her rat.” The older Duilia grew, the less
      inclined she was to acknowledge her age, and the more frivolous and scheming she became. She
      was never weary of weaving little webs of mystery and of contriving plans; and the initiating
      of all these was a supper. She was well off, liked ostentation, yet was withal of a frugal
      mind, and never ordered costly dishes, or broached her best wine without calculation that they
      would lead to valuable results. 
 It was possible that Vespasian might have interfered in favor of Domitia, had he been made
      to understand how strongly she disliked the union, but Domitia herself was never able to
      obtain an interview with the aged Emperor, and Duilia took pains to assure him that the
      marriage had been contracted entirely with her approval, that the union with Lamia had been
      entered on without feeling on either side, in obedience to an expressed wish of Corbulo before
      his death, and that her daughter was quite content to be released. 
 The period was not one in which the personal feel
      ings of a girl were counted as deserving of much thought, certainly not of being
      considered by an Emperor, and Vespasian took no steps to relieve Domitia. Titus was better
      aware of the facts, and had some notion of the wrench it had been to the young married people,
      but he was not desirous of having the matter reopened. It would not conduce to the credit of
      the Flavian house, and that was in his eyes a matter of paramount consideration—as the process
      of deification of the Flavians had already begun. 
 “What can I do for thee, Domitia?” asked Titus, who was pacing the room; he halted before
      the young wife of his brother, who was kneeling on the mosaic floor. 
 She had taken advantage of her introduction into the Imperial palace to make an appeal to
      Titus, now Emperor. She had not been allowed to appear there during the reign of Vespasian. 
 Titus was a tall, solidly built man, with the neck of a bull; he had the same vulgarity of
      aspect that characterized both his father and brother, and which was also conspicuous in his
      daughter Julia. The whole Flavian family looked, what it was, of ignoble origin,—there was
      none of the splendid beauty that belonged to Augustus, and to the Claudian family that
      succeeded. Their features were fleshy and coarse, their movements without grace, their address
      without dignity. 
 If they attempted to be gracious, they spoiled the graciousness by clumsiness in the act;
      if they did a generous thing, it carried its shadow of meanness trailing behind it. 
 Titus had not borne a good character before his elevation to the purple. He had indulged in
      coarse vices, had shown himself callous toward human suffering. Yet there was in his muddy
      nature a spark of good
      feeling, a desire to do what was right, a rough sense of justice and much family
      affection. 
 It was a disappointment to him that he had but one child, a daughter, a gaunt, stupid girl,
      big-boned, amiable and ugly. 
 He knew that Domitian, his younger brother, would in all probability succeed him, but he
      also was childless. Next to him, the nearest of male kin, were the sons of that Flavius
      Sabinus, who had been butchered by the Vitellians, and their names were Sabinus and Clemens. 
 The former was much liked by the people, he was an upright grave man. The second was
      regarded with distrust, as a Christian. It was not the fact of his following a strange
      religion that gave offence. To that Romans were supremely indifferent, but that which they
      could not understand and allow was a man withdrawing himself from the public service, the
      noblest avocation of a man, because he scrupled to worship the image of the Emperor, and to
      swear by his genius. They regarded this as a mere excuse to cover inertness of character, and
      ignobility of mind. 
 For the like reason, Christians could not attend public banquets or go to private
      entertainments as the homage done to the gods, and the idolatrous offerings associated with
      them, stood in their way. The profession of Christianity, accordingly, not only debarred from
      the public service, but interfered with social amenities. Such withdrawal from public social
      life the Romans could not understand, and they attributed this conduct to a morbid hatred
      entertained by the Christians for their fellow-men. 
 The public shows were either brutal or licentious. The Christians equally refused to be
      present at the gladiato
      rial combats and at the coarse theatrical representations of broad comedy and low
      buffoonery. This also was considered as indicative of a gloomy and unamiable spirit. 
 There were indeed heathen men who loathed the frightful butchery in the arena, such was the
      Emperor Tiberius,—and Pliny in his letters shows us that to some men of his time they were
      disgusting, but nevertheless they attended these exhibitions, as a public duty, and contented
      themselves with expressing objection to them privately. The objection was founded on taste,
      not principle, and therefore called for no public expression of reprobation. 
 Clemens was quite out of the question as a successor. If he was too full of scruple to take
      a prætorship, he was certainly unfit to be an emperor. Not so Flavius Sabinus his elder
      brother. Him accordingly, Domitian looked upon with jealousy. 
 “What can I do for thee?” again asked Titus, and his heavy face assumed a kindly
      expression; “my child, I know that thou hast had trouble and art mated to a fellow with a
      gloomy, uncertain humor; but what has been done cannot be undone——” 
 “Pardon me,” interrupted Domitia, “it is that I desire; let me be separated from him. I
      never, never desired to leave my true husband, Lamia, I was snatched away by violence—let me
      go back.” 
 “What! to Lamia! That will hardly do. Would he have thee?” 
 “Tainted by union with Domitian, perhaps not!” exclaimed Domitia fiercely. “Right indeed—he
      would not.” 
 “Nay, nay,” said Titus, his brow clouding, “such a word as that is impious, and in another
      would be trea
      son. Domitia, you have a bitter tongue. I have heard my brother say as much. But
      I cannot think that Lamia would dare to receive thee again after having been the wife of a
      Flavian prince.” 
 Domitia’s lip curled, but she said nothing. These upstart Flavians made a brag of their
      consequence. 
 “Then,” said she, “let me go to my old home at Gabii. I have lived in seclusion enough at
      Albanum to find Gabii in the current of life—and my mother and her many friends will come
      there anon. Let me go. Let there be a divorce—and I will go home and paddle on the lake and
      pick flowers and seek to be heard of no more.” 
 “It would not do for you and Lamia to be married again. It would be a political error; it
      might be dangerous to us Flavians.” 
 “I should have supposed, in your brand-new divinity that a poor mouse like myself could not
      have scratched away any of the newly-laid-on gold leaf.” 
 “Domitia,” said Titus, who had resumed his walk, “be careful how you let that tongue act—it
      is a file, it has already removed some of the gilding.” 
 A smile broke out on his face at first inclined to darken. 
 “There! There!” said he, laughing; “I am not a fool. I know well enough what we were, as I
      feel what we have become. Caligula threw mud, the mud of Rome, into the lap of my grandfather,
      because he had not seen to the efficient scouring of the streets. It was ominous—the soil of
      Rome has been taken away from the divine race of Julius—and has been cast into the lap of us
      money-lenders, pettyfogging attorneys of Reate. Well! the Gods willed it, Domitia—it is
      necessary for us to make a display.” 
 “Push, as my mother would say.” 
 “Well—push—as you will it. But, understand, Domitia, though I am not ignorant of all this,
      I don’t like to have it thrown in my teeth; and my brother is more sensitive to this than
      myself. Domitia, I will do this for you. I will send for him, and see if I can induce him to
      part from you. I mistrust me,”—Titus smiled, looked at Domitia, with one finger stroked her
      cheek, and said,—“By the Gods! I do not wonder at it. I would be torn by wild horses myself
      rather than abandon you, had I been so fortunate——” 
 “Sire, so wicked——” 
 “Well, well! you must excuse Domitian. Love, they say, rules even the Gods, and is stronger
      than wine to turn men’s heads.” 
 He clapped his hands. A slave appeared. “Send hither the Cæsar,” he ordered. The slave
      bowed and withdrew. 
 Domitian entered next moment. He must have been waiting in an adjoining apartment. 
 “Come hither, brother,” said Titus. “I have a suppliant at my feet, and what suppose you
      has been her petition?” 
 Domitian looked down. He had a pouting disdainful lip, a dogged brow, and eyes in which
      never did a sparkle flash; but his face flushed readily, not with modesty, but shyness or
      anger. 
 “Brother,” said Domitian, “I know well enough at what she drives. From the moment, the
      first moment I knew her, she has treated me to quip and jibe and has sought to keep me at a
      distance. I know not whether she use a love-philtre so as to hold me? I know not if it be her
      very treatment of me which makes
      me love her the more. Love her! It is but the turning of a hair whether I love or
      hate her most. I know what is her petition without being told, and I say—I refuse consent.” 
 “Listen to what I have to propose,” said Titus, “and do not blurt out your family quarrels
      before I speak about them. It is not I only, but all Rome, that knows that your life together
      is not that of Venus’s doves. It is unpleasant to me, it detracts from the dignity of the
      Flavian family”—he glanced aside at his sister-in-law, and his lips quivered, “that this
      cat-and-dog existence should become the gossip of every noble house, and a matter of
      tittle-tattle in every wine-shop. Make an end to it and repudiate her.” 
 Domitian kept his eyes on the floor. Domitia looked at him for his answer with eagerness.
      He turned on her with a vulgar laugh and said:— 
 “Vixen! I see thee—naught would give thee greater joy than for me to assent. I should see
      thee skip for gladness of heart, as I have never seen thee move thy little feet since thou
      hast been with me! I should hear thee laugh—and I have heard no sound save flout from thee as
      yet. I should see a sun dance in thine eyes, that perpetually lower or are veiled in tears. Is
      it not so?”—He paused and looked at her with truculence in his face—“and therefore, for that
      alone, I will not consent.” 
 “Listen further to me, Domitian,” said Titus; “I have a proposition to make. Separate from
      Domitia, send her back——” 
 “What, into the arms of Lamia?” 
 “No, to Gabii. She shall be guarded there, she shall not remarry Lamia.” 
 “I shall take good heed to that.” 
 “Hear me out, Domitian. I have but one child,
      Julia. The voice of the people has proclaimed itself well pleased with our house.
      We have given to Rome peace and prosperity at home, and victory abroad. I believe that there
      are few who regard me unfavorably. But it is not so with thee. Thy folly, thy disorders, thy
      violence, before our father came to Rome, have not been forgotten or forgiven, and Senate and
      people look on thee with mistrust. I will give thee Julia to wife. It is true she is thy
      niece—but since Claudius took Agrippina——” 
 “Thanks, Titus, I have no appetite for mushrooms.”
     
 “Tut! you know Julia, a good-hearted jade.” 
 “I will not consent,” said Domitian surlily. 
 “Hear me out, brother, before making thy decision. If thou wilt not take Julia, then I
      shall give her to another——” 
 “To whom?” asked Domitian looking up. He at once perceived that a danger to himself lurked
      behind this proposal. The husband of Julia might contest his claims to the throne, should the
      popularity of Titus grow with years, and his own decline. 
 “I shall give her to our cousin, Flavius Sabinus.” 
 Domitian was silent, and moved his hands and feet uneasily. 
 Looking furtively out of the corners of his eyes, he saw a flash of hope in those of
      Domitia. 
 He held up his head, and looking with leaden eyes at his brother, said:— 
 “Still I refuse.” 
 “The consequences—have you considered them?” 
 Domitian turned about, and made a tiger-like leap at Domitia and catching her by her
      shoulders said:— 
 “I hate her. I will risk all, rather than let her go free.” 
 Domitian had been accorded by his brother a portion of the palace of Tiberius on the
      Palatine Hill, that was crowded with imperial residences; and Domitia had been brought there
      from Albanum. 
 She was one day on the terrace. The hilltop was too much encumbered with buildings to
      afford much space for gardens, but there were platforms on which grew cypresses, and about the
      balustrades roses twined and poured over in curtains of flower. Citrons and oleanders also
      stood in tubs, and against the walls glistened the burnished leaves of the pomegranate; the
      scarlet flowers bloomed in spring and the warm fruit ripened till it burst in the hot autumn. 
 Domitia, seated beside the balustrade, looked over mighty Rome, the teeming forum, roofs
      with gilded tiles of bronze, lay below her, flashing in the sun, and beyond on the Capitol,
      white as snow, but glinting with gold, was the newly completed temple of Jupiter, rebuilt in
      greater splendor than before since the disastrous fire. 
 The hum of the city came up to her as the murmur of a sea, not a troubled one, but a sea of
      a thousand wavelets trifling with the pebbles of a beach, and dancing in and out among the
      teeth of a reef; a hum not unlike that of the bees—but somewhat louder, and pitched on a lower
      note. 
 Domitia paid no attention to the scene, nor to the sounds, she was engaged with her
      jewel-box, that she had brought forth into the sun, in order that she might count over her
      treasures. 
 At a respectful distance sat Euphrosyne spinning. 
 Domitia had some Syrian filagree gold work in her hand—it formed a decoration for the head,
      to be fastened by two pins; the heads were those of owls with opals for eyes. 
 She laid it aside and looked at her rings and brooches. There was one of the latter, a
      cameo given her by her mother, of coral of two hues, a Medusa’s head, a beautiful work of art.
      Then she took up a necklace of British pearls from the Severn, she twisted it about her arm
      and lovely were the pure pearls against her delicate flesh,—like the dainty tints on the rose
      and white coral of the brooch she had laid aside. 
 She replaced the chain, and took up a cornelian fish. 
 “Euphrosyne,” said Domitia, “come hither! observe this fish. Thy sister gave it me the day
      I was married, but alack! it brought me no luck. Think you it is an omen of ill? But Glyceria
      would not have given me one such.” 
 “Nay, lady, the fish brings the greatest happiness.” 
 “What is its meaning? It is a strange symbol. It must have some purport.” 
 The slave hesitated about answering. 
 Then, hearing steps on the pavement, and looking round, Domitia called—“Thou! Elymas! who
      pretendest to know all things, answer me this, I have an amulet—a fish—what doth it portend?” 
 “What?—the murex? That gives the imperial purple.” 
 “Bah! It is no murex, not a sea snail but a fish. What is the signification?” 
 “Lady, to one so high, ever-increasing happiness.” 
 “Away! you are all wrong. Happiness is not where you deem it. False thou art, false to thy
      creed. Thou speak of a divine ray in every man and woman! an emanation from the
      Father of Light, quivering, battling, straining to escape out of its earthly envelope and soar
      to its source!—thou speak of this, and in all thy doings and devisings seekest what is sordid
      and dark!” 
 The gloomy man folded his cloak about him, and looking at her from under his penthouse
      brows answered:— 
 “Thou launchest forth against me without reason. Knowest thou what is a comet? It is a star
      that circles about the sun and from it drinks in all the illumination it can absorb, like as
      the thirsty soil in summer sucks in the falling rain, or the fields the outflow of the Alban
      Lake; then it flies away into space, and as it flies it sheds its effulgence, becoming ever
      more dim till it reaches infinite darkness and is there black in the midst of absolute
      nigritude. Then it turns and comes back to replenish its urn.” 
 “Nay,” said Domitia, “that can never be. When all light is gone, then all desire for return
      goes likewise. I know that in myself—I—I am such a comet. When I was a child I longed, I
      hungered for the light, and in my days of adolescence it was the same, only stronger—it was as
      a famine. I was the poor comet sweeping up towards my sun; but where my sun was, that—in the
      vast abyss of infinity—I knew not. I sought and found not, I sought and shed my glory, till
      there was but a faint glimmer left in me;
      and now—now all light is extinguished, and with it desire to know, to love, to be
      happy, to return.” 
 “Madam, you, as the comet, are reaching your apogee, your extreme limit; you must shed all
      your light before you can return to the source of light.” 
 “What! is that your philosophy? The Father of Light sends forth his ray to expire in utter
      darkness, predestined this ray of light to extinction. If so—then He is not good. And yet,”
      she sighed, “it is so. I am such. In blackness of night. Look you, Elymas, when I was a child,
      I laughed and danced; I cannot dance, I can but force a laugh now. I once loved the flowers
      and the butterflies; I love them no more. My light is gone. The faculty of enjoyment is gone
      with it. Do I want to return? To what? To the source of light that launched me into this
      misery? No, not into that cold and cruel fate. Let me go on my inky way, I have no more light
      to lose—I look only to go out as a fallen star and leave nothing behind me.” 
 “What! when a great future is before you?” 
 “What future? you have none to offer me that I value. Away with your hints concerning the
      purple—it is the sable of mourning to me.” 
 She panted. The tears came into her eyes. 
 “It is you who have wrecked my life—you—you. It was you who devised that crime—when I was
      snatched away from the only man I loved—the only man with whom I could have been happy—whom
      I—” she turned aside and hid her face. Then recovering herself, but with a cheek glistening
      with tears, she said: “I admit it, I love still, and ever shall love. And he loves me. He has
      taken none to wife, for he thinks on me. There, could darkness be deeper than
      my now condition? And you did it, you betrayed me into the hands—” she had
      sufficient self-control not to say to whom, before this man and her slave. 
 “Lady, it is not I, but Destiny.” 
 “And you, with your tortuous ways, work to ends that you desire, and excuse it by saying,
      It is Destiny.” 
 “What, discussing the lore of emanations, little woman?” asked the Emperor, coming suddenly
      up. 
 Elymas stood back and assumed a deferential attitude. Titus waved him to withdraw, and was
      obeyed. Then he took Domitia by the hand. 
 “A philosopher, are you?” 
 “No, I ask questions, but get no answers that content me.” 
 “Ah! you asked a favor of me the other day and spiced it with a sneer—your jibes hit me.” 
 “I meant not to give pain.” 
 “I have come to you touching this very matter. I am not sure, child, that the scandal is
      not greater so long as you and Domitian remain linked together, and pulling opposite ways,
      than if you were parted. Your quarrels are now the talk of Rome, and many a cutting jest is
      put into your pretty mouth at our expense; invented by others, attributed to you.” 
 “You will have us divorced!” her breath came quick and short. 
 “Listen to what I propose. Domitia, I am not well. I have this accursed Roman fever on me.” 
 “Sire, I mark suffering in your face.” 
 “It has been vexing me for some days, and it is my intent to leave Rome and be free from
      business and take my cure at Cutiliæ—our old estate in the Sabine country. Perhaps the air,
      the waters of the old home,
      the nest of our divine family—” his mouth twitched, but there was a sad
      expression in his face—“they may do me good. It is something, Domitia, to stand on the soil
      that was turned by one’s forbears, when they bent as humble farmers over the plough. They were
      honest men and happy; and when one is down at heart, there is naught like home—the old home
      where are the bones of one’s ancestors, though they may have been yeomen, and one a
      commissioner, and another an usurer, and so on. They were honest men. Aye! the rate-collector,
      he was an honest man. Here all is false, and unreal, and—Domitia—I feel that I want to stand
      on the soil where my worthy, humble, dear old people worked and worshipped, and laid them down
      to die.” 
 “You are downcast indeed,” said Domitia. 
 “And because downcast, I have been brooding over your troubles, little sister-in-law. Come!
      I did something for your poor Lamia,—I made him consul, and I will do more. Can you be patient
      and tarry till my strength is restored? I shall return from my family farm in rude health, I
      trust, and by the Gods! the first matter I will then take in hand will be yours. I know what
      my brother is. By Jupiter Capitolinus! if Rome should ever have him as its prince, it will
      weep tears of blood. I know his savage humor and his sullen mind. No, Domitia, you cannot be
      happy with him. A cruel wrong was done you, and when I return from Cutiliæ I will right it.
      You shall be separated!” 
 She threw herself at his feet. 
 He smiled, and withdrawing from her clasp, said:— 
 “I will do more than that for your very good friend, in whom you still take such a lively
      interest.
      I shall find means to advance him to some foreign post—he knows Antioch, I will
      give him the proconsulship of Syria and Cilicia, and so move him away from Rome. And then—” he
      took a turn, looked smilingly at Domitia, and said,—“I do not see that you need mope at Gabii.
      You know Antioch; you were there for some years. It is, I believe, not well for a governor to
      take his wife with him; she has the credit of being a very horse-leech to the province. But I
      can trust thee, little woman! There, no thanks, I seek mine own interest, and to protect our
      divine images and the new gilding from the rasp of that tongue. That is the true motive of my
      making this offer. Do not thank me. On my return from Cutiliæ you may reckon on me.” 
 Then hastily brushing away her thanks, and evading her arms, extended to clasp him, he
      walked from the terrace. 
 “Euphrosyne!” cried Domitia, “did you hear! The comet has reached its extreme limit, it is
      turning—it is drawing to the light—to hope. Happiness is near—ah!” 
 In her excitement she had struck her jewel-case that stood on the marble balustrade, and
      sent it, with all its costly contents, flying down the precipice into the thronged lanes at
      the back of the forum in a glittering rain. 
 “Ye Gods!” gasped Domitia, “the omen! O ye Gods! the bad omen.” 
 “Lady,” said Euphrosyne, “all is not lost” 
 “What remains? Ah! the Fish!” 
 “Yes, mistress dear, when all else is lost, remember the Fish.” 
 “Now, for a while I am as one who has cast off a nightmare,” said Domitia to herself. “He
      is away—why he has attended Titus to the Sabine land I know not, unless the Emperor could not
      trust him in Rome—or may be, in his goodness he has done it to relieve me of his presence. I
      will go see my mother.” 
 Domitia ordered her litter and bearers. She had no trinkets to put on, save the fish of
      cornelian. Her mother liked to see her tricked out, and usually when Domitia paid her a visit
      she adorned herself to please the old lady,—now she could not assume jewelry as she had lost
      all her articles of precious stones and metal. So she hung the cornelian amulet about her
      neck. 
 When a Roman lady went forth in palanquin, it was in some state. Before her went two
      heralds in livery, to clear the way and announce her coming at the houses where she purposed
      calling, then she had six bearers, and attendants of her own sex, carrying her scent bottles,
      kerchiefs, fans, and whatever she might think it possible she would require. 
 Domitia was impatient of display, but it had been imposed on her by the Emperor. “The
      Flavians,” said he smiling, “must make a show in public.” 
 A Roman lady was at this period expected to wear yellow hair, if she would be in the
      fashion. Under the
      Flavians, it was a compliment to the reigning princes to affect this color. It
      was true that the word flavus meant anything in color, from mud upwards to
      what might be termed yellow by courtesy. It was employed as descriptive of the Tiber, that was
      of the dingiest of drabs, and of the Campagna when every particle of vegetation was burnt up
      on it, and the tone was that of the dust-heaps. But now that the parsnip-haired Flavians were
      divine and all-powerful, the adjective was employed to describe the harvest field and gold.
      Ladies talked of their hair as “flavan” when it had been dyed with saffron and dusted with
      gold. Not to have yellow hair was expressive of disaffection to the dynasty—so every lady who
      would be in the fashion, and every husband who wanted office, first bleached and then dyed
      their hair, and as hair was occasionally thin, they employed vast masses of padding and
      borrowed coils from German “fraus” to make the utmost show of their loyalty to the august
      house of the divine Flavii. 
 Domitia dared not be out of fashion, and she was constrained to submit to having her
      chestnut hair dredged with gold-dust before she went forth on her visit. For her,
      conspicuously to wear her hair in its natural color would at once have provoked animadversion,
      and been interpreted as a publication, in most defiant manner, of the domestic discord that
      was a topic of gossip in the saloons of Rome. 
 When she had entered her palanquin, she gave her orders and was carried lightly down the
      sloping road into the Forum. This was crossed, and then, drawing back the curtains of her
      litter, she said:— 
 “Eboracus, tell the fellows not to go at once to the
      Carinæ. I have a fancy to see the wife of Paris the actor, in the
       Insula of Castor and Pollux.” 
 She was playing with the fish suspended on her bosom, as she was being conveyed down the
      hill, and the thought had come to her that she had not seen Glyceria for a long time, and that
      now was a good occasion as her husband—whom these visits annoyed, and who had in fact
      forbidden them—was absent from Rome. 
 The porters at once entered the narrow, tortuous lanes, where the lofty blocks of buildings
      cut off all sun and made twilight in midday. 
 As Domitia stepped out of her litter, she saw coming down the street, a man much in the
      company of Domitian, for whom she entertained a particular dislike. He was a very dark man,
      and blind; his face was pointed, and his nose long; he ran with projecting head, turning his
      sharp nose from side to side, like a dog after game. His name was Valerius Messalinus. 
 One of his slaves whispered something into his ear, and he twisted about his head, and then
      came trotting in the direction of the litter of Domitia. 
 “Quick,” said she, “I must go in; I will not speak with that man. If he asks for me, say I
      am out—out of the litter.” 
 She at once entered the block of lodgings, and impatiently waved back her heralds, who
      would have ascended the stairs before her and pompously announced her arrival. 
 Taking Euphrosyne along with her, Domitia made her way towards the apartments of the
      crippled woman. But already the news had spread that men in the im
      perial livery had entered the building, and there was a rush to the balustrade to
      see them. 
 When Domitia reached the first landing, she saw that the women and children, and such men
      as were there, had ranged themselves on either side, to give her passage, every face was
      smiling, and lit with pleasure, the men raised their forefingers and thumbs to their mouths,
      and the women and children strove to catch her hand, or kneeling to touch, raise and kiss the
      hem of her dress. 
 If, at one time it had caused surprise that she a rich lady, should enter a common haunt of
      the poor, it was now a matter of more than surprise, of admiration and delight—to welcome the
      sister-in-law of the Emperor, one who it was whispered would some day be herself Empress,
      Augusta, and an object of religious worship. 
 This sort of welcome always went to the heart of Domitia, and gave her a choke in the
      throat. 
 The great people never regarded the poor, save as nuisances. An emperor had said of the
      populace that it was a wolf he held by the ears. And it was wolf-like because brutally
      treated, pampered as to food given without pay, supplied with scenes of bloodshed, also
      without cost, in the arena, every encouragement to work taken from it, every demoralizing,
      barbarizing influence employed to degrade it. 
 The great people were supremely indifferent to the sufferings of the small, provided no
      hospitals for the poor who were sick, no orphanages for the homeless children—let them die—and
      the faster the better,—that was one wish of the great;—then shall we be alone on the earth
      with our slaves. 
 Had these poor people hopes, ambitions, cares, sor
      rows? Did they love their wives, and hold to their hearts their cubs of children?
      Did they have any desire that their children should grow up to be good men and virtuous women?
      Oh, no! such rabble were not of one blood with the rich. They had no fine feelings, they were
      like the beasts; they were without human souls; and so, when the poor died their bodies were
      rammed down wells contrived to contain a thousand corpses at a time, and then heaped over with
      a little earth. 
 But Domitia had learned that it was not as supposed. Amidst the falsity, barbarity of
      heart, and coarseness of mind of such as were of the noble Roman order,—the cultured, the
      rich, the philosophic—there was no sincerity, no truth. She felt happier and better after one
      of these visits to the Insula in the Suburra as though her lungs had
      inhaled a purer atmosphere. To the smiles and kisses and blessings lavished on her, she
      answered with kindly courtesy—and then stepped into the room of the paralyzed woman. Glyceria
      was as much a cripple as when first visited. She was more wasted—some time had passed—but she
      hardly seemed older, only more beautiful in her purity, a diaphanous lamp of mother-of-pearl
      through which shone a supernatural light. 
 Domitia drew a deep sigh. 
 “Glyceria,” she said, “when I come here, it is to me like seeing a glimpse of blue sky
      after a day of rain, or—like the scent of violets that came on me the first time I visited
      you.” 
 “And when you, lady, come to me, it is as though a sunbeam shone into my dark chamber.” 
 “Nay, nay—no flattery from thee, or I shall hate
      thee. I get that till it cloys. But tell me now, times have been better, and why
      has not Paris moved into superior quarters? Surely he is in better employ and pay than of
      old.” 
 “It is so, but only to a small degree,” answered the actor’s wife. “Paris performs in the
      grand old dramas in Greek only; in those of Æschylus and Eurypides and Sophocles, he is a
      tragic actor,—and—” the poor woman smiled, “perhaps home troubles have taken the laughter out
      of him. He is a sad bungler in comedy. Now the taste of Rome is not for the masterpieces of
      the ancients. The people clamor to see an elephant dance on a tight-rope, and a man crucified
      who pours forth blood enough to swamp the stage—the Laureolus! that is the piece to bring down
      the house. Or some bit of buffoonery and indecency. To that the people crowd. However, we
      live; I hang as a log about my Paris’s neck, but thank God, he loves his log and would not be
      rid of it, so I am content.” 
 “But if you will suffer me to assist you,” said Domitia. 
 Glyceria shook her head. “No, dear lady, do not take it ill if I refuse your kind offer,
      made, not for the first time. I am very happy here, very—with these dear kind people about me,
      running in and out all the day, offering their gracious good wishes, lending their ready help.
      On my word, lady! I do believe that they would all be in tears and feel it as a slight if I
      were to go; and for myself, I could never be happy away from them.” 
 Domitia stood up and went to the door. Her heart swelled in her bosom. 
 “None but the poor know,” said the cripple, “how kind, how tender the poor are to one
      another. Poverty is a brotherhood—we are all of one blood, and one heart.” 
 “And I—” said the great lady, looking out on the balcony with its swarm of people, some
      busy, some idle, most merry—“And I—” said she, dreamily—“I love the poor.” 
 “Then,” said a low firm voice, “thou art not far from the Kingdom of Heaven.” 
 She turned and started. 
 She recollected him, that stately man with deep, soft eyes. Luke, the Physician. 
 “I am not surprised,” he added, “if you be His disciple,” and he touched the cornelian
      fish. 
 It was not strange that in this splendid lady with golden hair he did not recognize the
      timid, crushed girl with auburn locks, he had seen on the Artemis. 
 But the recollection of that night came back with a rush like a tidal wave, over Domitia,
      and she threw forth the question, “Why did you cut the thong?” 
 He did not comprehend her. She saw it, and added, “You do not recollect me. Do you not
      recall when we nearly ran down the galley of that monster Nero? On that night, we would have
      sent him to the bottom of the sea, but for you,—you spoiled it all; you cut the thong of the
      rudder. Why did you prevent us from doing it?” 
 “Because,” answered the physician, “It is written, Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith
      the Lord. It was not for you to do it. You were not called to be the minister of His
      sentence.” 
 “I understand you not.” 
 “My daughter——” 
 “Hold!” said Domitia, rearing herself up. “Dost thou know to whom thou addressest thyself?
      I—I thy daughter? I am Domitia Longina, daughter of the
      great Corbulo, and—” but she would not add, “wife of the Cæsar
      Domitian.” 
 “Well, lady,” said Luke, “forgive me. I thought, seeing that sign on thy breast, and
      hearing thee say that thou didst love the poor, that thou wast one whom, whatever thy rank and
      wealth and position I might so address, not indeed as one of the Brethren, but as a hearer and
      a seeker—enough—I was mistaken.” 
 “What means this fish?” asked Domitia, her wounded pride oozing away at once. “I pray you
      forgive me. I spoke hastily.” 
 “The fish,” said he— 
 But before he could offer any explanation, Paris appeared, his face expressive of alarm; he
      had seen the servants in the imperial white below, and knew therefore whom to find in his
      wife’s lodgings. 
 He hastily saluted her and said:— 
 “Lady! I beseech thee to go at once. Something has occurred most grave. Return immediately
      to the palace.” 
 “What is it? Tell me.” 
 “Madam, I dare not name it, lest it be untrue. To speak of it if untrue were to be guilty
      of High Treason.” 
 “High Treason!” gasped Domitia. She knew what such a charge entailed. 
 “The Cæsar Domitian has passed at full gallop through the streets, his attendants behind
      him.” 
 “Whither has he gone?” 
 “To the Prætorian barracks.” 
 “Ye Gods!” spoke Domitia, she could not raise her voice above a whisper. “Then
      the worst has happened. My light is out once more.” 
 On reaching the street, Domitia saw at once that the aspect of the populace was changed.
      Instead of the busy hum of trade, the calls of hucksters, the laugh of the mirthful, a
      stillness had come on every one; no face smiled, no voice was raised, scarcely any person
      moved. 
 Those who had been bustling here and there stood motionless, trade had ceased. A sudden
      frost had arrested the flow of life and reduced all its manifestations to the lowest term.
      Such as had been running about collected in clusters, and conversed in whispers. Blank faces
      looked at Domitia as she entered her litter, with awed respect. 
 “Eboracus! What is the meaning of this?” asked the lady. 
 “Madam, I know not. None will confide what they seem to know or to suspect.” 
 “Go forward,” said she, “I will visit my mother in the Carinæ. She will know everything.” 
 In another moment her train was in movement, and as she passed along, all bowed and saluted
      with their hands; they had done as much previously, but without the earnestness that was now
      observable. In the heart of Domitia was as it were a blade of ice transpiercing it. She was in
      deadly alarm lest her surmise should prove true. 
 She would not draw the curtains of her litter, but looked at everything in the streets, and
      saw that all were in the same condition of stupefaction. 
 On reaching the entrance to the palace occupied by her mother, Domitia noticed another
      palanquin and attendants. 
 “The Vestal Abbess, Cornelia, is with the Lady Duilia,” said Eboracus. 
 “I will go in!—I know her well, and esteem her,” said Domitia. 
 She passed the vestibule, traversed the Atrium and entered the Tablinum. But Longa Duilia
      was not there. A slave coming up, said that she had entered with the Great Mother into a
      private apartment, where she might not be disturbed. 
 “Well! I am no stranger. Lead the way.” 
 In another instant she was ushered into her mother’s presence, and at once Duilia bowed to
      her with profound respect. 
 “Mother—what does this mean?” 
 “Here is the Lady Abbess, Cornelia, let me present her to your Highness.” 
 “Mother—I salute the Lady Cornelia—what is this that has cast a shadow over Rome and
      frightened the people as with an eclipse?” 
 “My dear, of course you have heard. It may be only rumor and yet,—he was suffering when he
      left Rome.” 
 “Ye Gods! do not say so! Mother, withdraw your words of bad omen. Naught has befallen him!
      It was but a slight fever.” 
 “So we esteemed it, but——” 
 “But, mother——” Domitia panted. 
 “The news are weighty, and concern you vastly, my daughter.” 
 “It is too horrible for me to think. Surely, surely, mother, it is false.” 
 “Hearken, my dear,—Lady Cornelia, come also to the top of the house. It is a fine situation
      for seeing and hearing, and out of all reach of eavesdroppers. I hear shouts, I hear horns
      blowing. Come—speedily! let us to the house-top.” 
 Laying hold of Domitia and the Vestal Superior by the wrists, she drew them with her to the
      roof. 
 The silence that had fallen on Rome had passed away, the town was now resonant with horns
      and trumpets pealing from the Prætorian camp, with the shouting of many voices from the same
      quarter. In the streets, messengers were running, armed with knotted sticks, and were
      hammering at the doors of Senators to summon them to an extraordinary meeting. The clash of
      arms resounded, so also the tramp of feet, as the city police marched in the direction of the
      Palatine. Here and there rose loud cries, but what they signified could not be judged. 
 In another moment Eboracus came out on the housetop, and hastening to his mistress, said:— 
 “Madam, the Augustus—Titus, has been. The Cæsar Domitian is proclaimed Emperor by
      the troops. The vigiles are hastening in cohorts to swear allegiance.” 
 “I congratulate you—I congratulate you with all my heart!” exclaimed Longa Duilia, throwing
      her arms round her daughter. “I have reached the summit of my ambition. I vow a kid to
      Febronia for her opportune—ahem!—but who would have thought the Roman fever would have been so
      speedy in bringing
      us luck. Run, Eboracus, summon the housekeeper; order the ancestral masks to be
      exposed, all the boxes opened, dust the noses with the feather brush; let the
       lares be garlanded. Tell Paulina to bring out the best incense, not the
      cheapest this time, and I vow I will throw a double pinch on the altar of the household gods.
      Who would have thought it! I—I, mother to an empress. I would dance on the house-top, but that
      my wig is not properly pinned, and might come off. I must, I positively must embrace you
      again, Domitia; and you too, Cornelia, I am so happy!—As the Gods love me! Wig pinned or not,
      I must dance.” 
 “Let us go down,” said Domitia in a hard tone. 
 “Come down, by all means,” acquiesced her mother. “I must see that the Gods be properly
      thanked. I stepped this morning out of bed left leg foremost. I
      knew some happiness would come to me to-day. As the Gods love me! I’ll give a little supper.
      Domitia! whom shall I invite? None of your second-class men now. There!—I thought as much; my
      wig has come off. Never mind! no men can see me, and women don’t count.” 
 On reaching the private apartment of the lady, Domitia said:— 
 “Mother—a word.” 
 She was white, save that a flame was kindled on each cheek-bone and her eyes scintillated
      like burning coals. 
 “Well, my dear, I am all ears—even to my toes.” 
 “Mother, he murdered him. I know it—I feared there was mischief meant, when Domitian
      attended him to Cutiliæ and took Elymas with him. It was not fever that——” 
 “My dear, don’t bother your head about these matters. They all do it. We women, I thank the
      Gods, are outside of politics. But—well—well, you must not say such things, not even think
      them. It is all for the best in the best of worlds. I never had the smallest wish to see
      behind the scenes. Always eat your meat cooked and spiced, and don’t ask to see it as it comes
      from the shambles. If you are quite positive, then I won’t throw away the kid on Febronia. It
      is of no use wasting money on a goddess who really has not helped.” 
 “Mother,” said Domitia, her whole frame quivering with excitement; “I am sure of it. Did
      not the Augustus give his daughter Julia to Flavius Sabinus? I know that Domitian was alarmed
      at that. I saw it in his looks, I heard it in his voice; his movements of hand and foot
      proclaimed it. He feared a rival. He feared what the will of Titus might be—whom he might name
      as his successor. Mark me, my mother; the first to fall will be Flavius Sabinus.” 
 “Hist! the word is of bad omen.” 
 “It was of bad omen to Sabinus and to Titus alike when Julia was given to her cousin.” 
 “Well, my dear,” said Longa Duilia, “I do not see that we need concern ourselves about
      politics. You see,—every night, stars drop out of the heavens; the firmament is overcrowded,
      and those stars that are firmest planted elbow out the weakest. It is their way in heaven, and
      what other can you expect on earth? Of course, it were much to be desired—and all that sort of
      thing; but we did not make the world, neither do we rule it. All eggs in a nest do not hatch
      out, some addle.” 
 “Mother, I will not go back to him.” 
 “Folly! you cannot do other.” 
 “I will not. My condition was bad enough before, it will be worse now.” 
 “Domitia, set your mind at rest. I have no doubt that there have been little
      unpleasantnesses. Man and wife do not always agree. Your poor father would not be ruled by me.
      If he had—ah me!—Things would have been very different in Rome. But he suffered for his
      obstinacy. You must be content to take things as you find them. Most certainly it would be
      better in every way if peacocks had eyes on both sides of their tails, but as they have not,
      only very silly peacocks turn about and expose the eyeless side. Make the best of matrimony.
      It is not many marriages are like young walnuts, that you can peel off the bitter and eat only
      the sweet. In most, the skin adheres so tightly that you have to take the sweet with the gall,
      and be content that there is any sweet at all.” 
 “I shall go away. I will not return to the palace.” 
 “Go whither? the world belongs to Domitian. There is not a corner where you can hide. There
      are officials, and when not officials—spies. I have no doubt that the fish in that tank put up
      their heads and wish they were butterflies to soar above the roof and get away and sport among
      the flowers, instead of going interminably about the impluvium. But, my
      dear, they can’t do it, so they acquiesce in tank existence. Yours is the finest and best lot
      in the world,—and you would surrender it! From being a lioness you would decline to be a house
      cat!” 
 Domitia turned abruptly away, tears of anger and disappointment were in her eyes. 
 She said in a muffled voice:— 
 “Lady Cornelia, will you come with me?” 
 “I am at your service,” answered the Vestal. 
 The ladies departed together, and at the portal each entered her own litter. 
 “To the Atrium Vestæ,” said Domitia. 
 Her retinue started, and a moment after followed that of the Vestal Cornelia. 
 The streets were full of excited multitudes, currents running up one side, down another,
      meeting, coming to a standstill, clotting, and choking the thoroughfares, then breaking up and
      flowing again. 
 If it had not been for the liveries of the two heralds, the palanquin of Domitia could not
      have got through, but when it was observed whose litter and servants were endeavoring to make
      way, the crowd readily divided, and every obstacle gave way immediately. But the Vestal
      Superior needed not that the Cæsar’s wife should open the road for her. As much respect was
      accorded to her as to Domitia. 
 Both trains, the one following immediately after the other, entered and traversed the
      Forum, passed the Temple of Julius, and at the south extremity reached the Atrium of the
      Vestal Virgins, a long building without a window, communicating with the outer world by a
      single door. 
 At this door Domitia descended from her litter, and awaited the Abbess. 
 Cornelia also stepped from her litter. She was a tall and stately lady of forty years, who
      had once been beautiful, but whose charms were faded. She smiled— 
 “You will pay me a visit, as you go your way? that is a gracious favor.” 
 “A lengthy visit,” said Domitia. 
 “Time will never seem long in your sweet society,” answered the Vestal and taking Domitia’s
      hand led her up the steps to the platform. 
 No sooner was Domitia there, than she ran to the altar of the Goddess on which burned the
      perpetual fire, within a domed Temple, and clasped it. Cornelia had followed her, and looked
      at her with surprise. 
 “I claim the protection of the Goddess,” said Domitia. “I will not return to
      the palace! I will be free from him.” 
 Cornelia became grave. 
 “If your Goddess has any might, any grace, she will protect me. Do you fear? Have you lost
      your rights? I claim them.” 
 “Be it so,” said the Abbess. “None have appealed to the Goddess in vain, none taken
      sanctuary with her, who have been rejected. She will maintain your cause.” 
 When the Romans were a pastoral people at Alba, then it was the duty of the young girls to
      attend to the common hearth and keep the fire ever burning. To obtain fresh fire was not
      always possible, and at the best of times not easy. 
 Fire was esteemed sacred, being so mysterious, and so indispensable, and reverence was made
      to the domestic hearth (hestia) as the altar of the Fire goddess. 
 When the Roman settlement was made on the banks of the Tiber, one hut of a circular form
      was constituted the central hearth, and provision was made that thence every household should
      obtain its fire. This hut became the Temple of Hestia or Vesta, and certain girls were set
      apart to watch the fire that it should never become extinguished. 
 This was the origin of the institution of the Vestal Virgins, an institution which lasted
      from the founding of Rome in B. C. 753, to the disestablishment of Paganism, and the expulsion
      of the last Vestal, in A. D. 394, nearly eleven hundred and fifty years. 
 No girl under six or above ten years of age was admissible as priestess of the sacred fire,
      and but six damsels were allowed,—their term of service was thirty years, after which the
      Vestal was free to return home and to marry. The eldest of the Vestals was
      termed Maxima, and she acted as superior or abbess over the community. 
 They enjoyed great possessions and privileges and were shown the most extraordinary
      respect. Seats of honor were accorded to the Vestals in the theatres, the amphitheatre and the
      circus. 
 The Vestals had other duties to perform beside that of maintaining the perpetual fire. They
      preserved the palladia of Rome, those mysterious articles on which the prosperity, nay, the
      very existence of the city was thought to depend. What these were was never known. The last
      Vestal carried them away and concealed them. With her death the secret was lost. Moreover,
      they took charge of the wills of great men, emperors and nobles, and in times of civil war
      they mediated between the conflicting parties. 
 Cornelia gently detached the hands of Domitia from the altar of Vesta, and led her within
      the college of the Vestals, the only door to which opened on the platform on which stood the
      Temple. 
 On entering, she found herself in an oblong court surrounded on all four sides by a
      cloister, the prototype of those to be in later days erected in the several convents and
      abbeys, and collegiate buildings of Christendom. In the open space in the midst was the
      circular treasury of the palladia, at one end was the well whence the virgins drew their
      water. The cloister was composed of marble columns, and sustained an upper gallery, also open
      to the court but roofed over and the roof supported on columns of red marble. 
 Between the columns below and above stood statues of the Superiors, who had merited
      commemoration.
      There was no garden, the place for walking was the cloister. 
 Cornelia conducted Domitia into the reception-chamber, and kissing her said:— 
 “Under the protection of the Goddess you are safe.” 
 “I trust I in no way endanger your safety.” 
 “Mine!” Cornelia laughed. “There is none above me save the supreme pontiff, and so long as
      I do no wrong, no one can molest me. But tell me—what wilt thou do?” 
 “In the first place send out and bid my servants return home; and if they ask when to come
      for me, answer, when I send for them.” 
 “That is easily done,” said the Abbess. She clapped her hands and a slave girl answered and
      received this commission. 
 “Now,” said she, “now we come to the real difficulty. Here you are, but here you cannot
      tarry for long. For six days we may accord sanctuary, but for no more. After that we must
      deliver over the person who has taken refuge with us if required.” 
 “I have for some time considered what might be done. I have been so miserable, so degraded,
      so impatient, that I have racked my brain how to escape, and I see but one course. When we
      were at Cenchræa, my mother and I, we were in the house of a Greek client of our family, who
      was very kind to us, and his wife loved me well. If I could escape thither in disguise, then I
      think he would be able to secrete me, there are none so astute as are the Greeks, and who so
      love to outwit their masters.” 
 “But how is this possible?” 
 “That I know not—only let me get away from Rome, then trust my craft to enable me to evade
      pursuit. Let it be given out that I am here in fulfilment of a vow, then no suspicion will be
      roused, and I can take my measures.” 
 “It is not possible,” said Cornelia in some alarm. “Have you considered what your mother
      said? the Augustus is all-seeing and all-powerful, and has his hand everywhere.” 
 “Get me out of Italy, and I shall be safe. I will not return to the Palatine. If my life
      was hateful to me before, what will it be made now? Then he had some fear of his
      father and of his brother, now he has none to fear.” 
 The Vestal said, “Let me have time to think this over—and yet, it doth not seem to me
      feasible.” 
 “Get me but a beggar’s suit, and walnut juice, that I may stain my face and hands and arms.
      I will wash all this gold-dust from my hair—and I warrant you none will know me, with a staff
      and a wallet, I will go forth, right willingly. I will not return to him.” 
 “That is impossible. You—with your beauty—your nobility——” 
 “My nobility is of no account with me now.” 
 “You think so, and so it may be whilst untouched, but I am certain the least ruffle would
      make your pride flash out.” 
 Domitia remembered her resentment at the physician’s apparent familiarity. 
 “Well—my beauty will be disguised.” 
 “That nothing can conceal.” 
 “Oh! do not speak thus, or I shall mistrust you, as I mistrust every one else—except my
      slave Euphro
      syne, and Eboracus, and Glyceria the actor’s wife. These seem to me the only true
      persons in the world. I would cast myself on them, but two are slaves and the other is
      paralyzed. Consider now, Cornelia, do you not understand how that one may reach a condition of
      mind or soul, call it which you will, when we become desperate. One must make an effort to
      break away into a new and free and better life, or succumb and become bad, and dead to all
      that is noble and true and good, hard of heart, callous to right and wrong. I am at that
      point. I know, if I were to return to him, and to be Empress of the Roman world, that
      I should have but one thing to live for—the pride of my place and the blazoning of my
      position; and to all that which lies deep within me, bleeding, crying out, hungering, and with
      dry lips—dead.” 
 “My dear lady, you were never made for what you are forced to become.” 
 “Then, why do the Gods thrust me on to a throne that I hate, tie me to a man that I loathe,
      surround me with a splendor that I despise. Tell me why? O Vesta! immaculate Goddess! how I
      would that I had been as one of thy consecrated virgins, to spend my days in this sweet house,
      and pure, peaceful cloister! Do you see? I must away. I am lost to all good—if I remain. I
      must away! it is my soul that speaks, that spreads its hands to thee, Cornelia! save me!” 
 She threw herself on her knees and extended her arms to the Vestal Abbess, caught her dress
      and kissed it. 
 Cornelia was deeply moved, 
 “I beseech you, rise,” she said, lifting the kneeling
      suppliant, clasping her in her arms, and caressing her as a child. 
 “Hearken to me, Domitia, I can think but of one person that can assist us; that is my
      cousin Celer. He is a good man, and whatever I desire, he will strive to execute as a sacred
      duty. Yet the risk is great.” 
 “I pray you!—I pray you get him to assist me to escape.” 
 “He must furnish you with attendants. It will not be secure for you to be accompanied by
      any of your own servants. They might be traced. Celer has got a villa. Stay, I will go forth
      at once and see him. He can give counsel. Do nothing till my return.” 
 The Vestal Great-Mother left, and Domitia was glad to be alone. 
 The habitation of the Vestals was wonderfully peaceful, in the midst of busy, seething
      Rome, and in the centre of its greatest movement. As already said, it had no windows, and but
      one door that opened on the outer world. It drew all its air, all its light, from the patch of
      sky over the central court. Figures of Vestals glided about like spirits, and the white
      statues stood ghostlike on their pedestals. 
 But to be without flowers, without a peristyle commanding a landscape of garden and lake
      and trees and mountains! That was terrible. It would have been an unendurable life, but that
      the Vestal college was possessed of country seats, to which some of the elder of the
      sisterhood were allowed occasionally to go and take with them some one or two of the novices. 
 Although there were no flowers in the quadrangle, there was abundance of birds. In and out
      among the variegated marbles, perching on balustrades, fluttering
      among the statues, were numerous pigeons, as marbled in tint as the sculptured
      stonework, and looking like animated pieces of the same; and a tame flamingo in gorgeous
      plumage basked himself, then strutted, and on seeing a Vestal approach hopped towards her.
      When, moreover, the same maiden drew water from the well, the pigeons came down like a fall of
      snow about her, clustering round the bucket to obtain a dip and a drink. 
 Several hours passed. At length the Abbess returned. She at once sought Domitia, who rose
      on her entry. Cornelia took both her hands within her own and said:— 
 “We women are fools, that is what Celer said, when I told him your plan. As he at once
      pointed out, it is impossible for you to lie hid anywhere in Italy—and impossible to escape
      from it, unknown to the Augustus. Any one endeavoring to assist you to escape would lose his
      life, most assuredly. “I cannot sell smoke to a clown,” said he bluntly—he is a plain man—“I
      will not put out a finger to assist in such an attempt, which would bring ruin on us all.
      But,” he said, “this may be done; let the Lady Domitia retire to one of her own villas, in the
      country, and commit the matter to the Vestals. Your entreaty is powerful, and if attended by
      two of the sisters—or perhaps better alone, for this is not a matter to be made public—go to
      the prince, and plead in the lady’s name, that thou feelest unequal to the weight of duties
      that will now fall on the Augusta, and that thy health is feeble and thou needest repose and
      country air—then he may yield his consent, at least to a temporary retreat.” But my kinsman
      Celer advised nothing beyond this. In very truth, nothing else can be done. Most men’s noses
      are crooked,—he
      said—and he is a blunt man—and those who have straight ones do not like to follow
      them. But in your case, Lady Domitia, there is practically no other way.” 
 “Then I will to Gabii,” said Domitia with a sigh. “If he will force me back—there is the
      lake.” 
 Then, said Cornelia, “Dost thou know that blind-man Messalinus?” 
 “Full well—he hangs on to the Cæsar Domitian, like a leech.” 
 “Since thou didst enter the house of us Vestals, he hath been up and down the Via Nova and
      the Sacred Way, never letting this place out of his eye—blind though he be. Some say he scents
      as doth a dog, and that is why he works his head about from side to side snuffing the wind.
      When I went forth he detached two of his slaves to follow—and they went as far as myself and
      stood watching outside the door of the knight Celer, and when I came forth they were still
      there, and when I returned to the Atrium of Vesta, I found Messalinus peering with his
      sightless eyes round the corner. But, I trow, he sees through his servants’ eyes.” 
 “He is a bird of ill omen,” said Domitia, “a vulture scenting his prey.” 
 Domitia was at Gabii. Cornelia, the Vestal Great Mother had sent her thither in her own
      litter, and attended by her own servants, but with the assistance of the knight Celer, who had
      gone before to Gabii to make preparations. 
 Gabii had none of the natural beauties of Albanum, but Domitia cared little for that. It
      was a seat that had belonged to her father and here his ashes reposed. The villa was by no
      means splendid; but then—nor had been that of Albanum when she was first carried thither.
      Domitian had bought it immediately after the proclamation of his father, and it had then been
      a modest, but very charming country residence. Since then, he had lavished vast sums upon it,
      and had converted it into a palace, without having really improved it thereby. To Albanum he
      had become greatly attached; to it he retired in his moody fits, when resentful of his
      treatment by his father, envious of his brother, and suspicious of his first cousin Sabinus.
      There he had vented his spleen in harassing his masons, bullying his slaves, and in sticking
      pins through flies. 
 But if Gabii was less beautiful and less sumptuous, it had the immeasurable advantage of
      not being occupied by Domitian. There, for a while, Domitia was
      free from his hateful society, his endearments and his insults, alike odious to
      her. 
 And she enjoyed the rest; she found real soothing to her sore heart in wandering about the
      garden, and by the lake, and visiting familiar nooks. 
 Only into the temple of Isis she did not penetrate, the recollection of the vision there
      seen was too painful to be revived. 
 On the third day after she had been in the Gabian villa, Celer came out from Rome. He was a
      plain middle-aged man with a bald head, and a short brusque manner, but such a man as Domitia
      felt she could trust. 
 He informed her that Cornelia had been before the Augustus and had entreated him to allow
      his wife to absent herself from the palace, and from his company. She had made the plea that
      Domitia Longina was out of health, overstrained by the hurry of exciting events, and that she
      needed complete rest. 
 “But I demand more than that,” said she. 
 “Madam, more than that, my cousin, the Great Mother, dared not ask. The prince was in a
      rough mood, he was highly incensed at your having withdrawn without his leave, and he saw
      behind Cornelia’s words the real signification. He behaved to her with great ill-humor, and
      would give no answer one way or the other—and that means that here you are to remain, till it
      is his pleasure to recall you.” 
 “And may that never be,” sighed Domitia. 
 “The Augustus is moreover much engaged at present.” 
 “What has he been doing? But stay—tell me now—is there news concerning Sabinus?” 
 “Ah lady! he has been.” 
 “I knew it would be so. On what charge?” 
 “The Augustus was incensed against him, because under the god Vespasian he had put his
      servant in the white livery, when Flavius Sabinus was elected to serve as consul for the
      ensuing year. Unhappily, the herald in announcing his election gave him the title of Emperor
      in place of consul, through a mere slip of the tongue. But it was made an occasion of
      delation. Messalinus snapped at the opportunity, and at once the noble Sabinus was found
      guilty of High Treason, and sentenced to death.” 
 “And what has become of Julia, daughter of the god Titus, the wife of Sabinus?” 
 “She has been brought by the Augustus to the Palatine.” 
 Next day, the slave Euphrosyne arrived. She had been sent for by Domitia, and was allowed
      to go to her mistress. She also brought news. 
 The town was in agitation. It was rumored that the Emperor was about to divorce Domitia,
      and to marry his niece. 
 “It would be welcome to me were this to take place,” said Domitia. “Come, now, Euphrosyne,
      bring me spindle and distaff, I will be as a spinster of old.” 
 So days passed, occasionally tidings came from Rome, but these were uncertain rumors.
      Domitia was enjoying absolute peace and freedom from annoyance in the country. And she had in
      Euphrosyne one with whom she talked with pleasure, for the girl had much to say that showed
      novelty, springing out of a mind very different in texture from that usual among slaves. 
 “It is a delight to me to be still. Child!—I can well
      think it, after a toilsome and discouraging life, it is pleasant to fold the
      hands, lay the head on the sod, and go to sleep, without a wish to further keep awake.” 
 “Yes, when there is a prospect of waking again.” 
 “But even without that, is life so pleasant that one would incline to renew it? Not I for
      one.” 
 Domitia looked up at the fresco of the Quest of Pleasure, and said—“Once I wondered at that
      picture yonder, and that all pleasure attained should resolve itself into a sense of
      disappointment. It is quite true that we pursue the butterfly, after we have ceased to value
      it, but that is because we must pursue something, not that we value that which is attained or
      to be attained.” 
 “Ah, lady, we must pursue something. That is in our nature—it is a necessity.” 
 “It is so; and what else is there to follow after except pleasure?” 
 “There is knowledge.” 
 “Knowledge! the froth-whipping of philosophers, the smoke clouds raised by the magicians,
      the dreams and fancies of astronomers—pshaw! I have no stomach for such knowledge. No! I want
      nothing but to be left alone, to dream away my remainder of life.” 
 “No, lady, that would not content you. You must seek. We are made to be seekers, as the
      bird is made to fly, and the fish to swim.” 
 “If we do not seek one thing, we seek another, and in every one, find—what the pinched
      butterfly is—dust.” 
 “No, mistress, not if we seek the truth. The knowledge of the truth, the Summum
       Bonum.” 
 “But where, how are we to seek it?” 
 “In God,” answered the slave. 
 “The Gods! of them we know only idle tales, and in place of the tales, when taken away,
      there remains but guesswork. There again—the pinch of dust.” 
 “Lady, if we are created to seek, as the fish to swim, there must be an element in which to
      pursue our quest, an end to attain. That is inevitable, unless we be made by a freakish
      malevolent power that plants in us desire that can feed only on dust, ever, ever dust. No,
      that cannot be, the soul runs because it sees its goal—” 
 “And that?—” 
 A bustle, and in a moment, in sailed Longa Duilia, very much painted, very yellow in hair,
      and with saffron eyelashes and brows. 
 “Little fool!” said the mother. “Come, let me embrace thee, yet gently lest you crumple me,
      and be cautious of thy kisses, lest thou take off the bloom of my cheek. Thou art ever
      boisterous in thy demonstrations. There, give me a seat, I must put up my feet. As the Gods
      love me! what a hole this Gabii is! How dingy, how dirty, how shabby it all looks! As the
      Gods—but how art thou? some say ill, some say sulky, some say turned adrift. As the Gods love
      me! that last is a lie, and I can swear it. The Augustus distills with love, like a dripping
      honeycomb. You must positively come back with me. I have come—not alone. Messalinus is with
      me—a charming man—but blind, blind as a beetle.” 
 “What, that fourfolder!”
     
 “Now, now, no slang! I detest it, it is vulgar. Besides, they all do it, and what all do
      can’t be wrong. One must live, and the world is so contrived that one lives upon another;
      consequently, it must be right.” 
 “Well have the Egyptians represented the God who made men as a beetle—blind, and this world
      as a pellet of dung rolled about blindly by him.” 
 “My dear, I am not a philosopher and never wish to be one. Come, we have brought the
      Imperial retinue for taking you back.” 
 “Whither? To your house in the Carinæ?” 
 “Oh, my Domitia! How ridiculous! Of course you go to the Palatine, to your proper place. My
      dear, you will be proclaimed Augusta, and receive worship as a divinity. The Senate are only
      pausing to adjudge you a goddess, to know whether the Emperor intends to repudiate you or no.
      It is absolutely necessary that you come back with me.” 
 “My godhead is determined by the question whether I be divorced or not!” exclaimed Domitia
      contemptuously. “I cannot go with you, mother.” 
 “Then,” said Duilia, looking carefully about, “that jade, big-boned and ugly as a mule—you
      know to whom I refer, will get the upper hand, and your nose will be broken.” 
 “Mother, I ask but to be left alone.” 
 “I will not suffer it. By my maternal authority——” 
 “Alas, mother! I have passed out of that—I did so at my marriage.” 
 “Well then, in your own interest.” 
 “If I consider that I remain here.” 
 “Avaunt nonsense! Your position, your opportu
      nities! Just think! There is cousin Cnæus must be given a help up. He is a
      fool—but that don’t matter, you must get him a proconsulship. Then there is Fulvia, you must
      exert yourself to find her a wealthy husband. As the Gods love me! you can push up all your
      father’s family, and mine to boot. Come, get the girls to dress you becomingly and make
      haste.” 
 “I cannot go.” 
 “You must. The Augustus wills it.” 
 “And if I refuse?” 
 “You cannot refuse.” 
 “I do so now.” 
 “My dear, by the Good Event! you shall come. You can no more refuse him than you can
      Destiny.” 
 “Let him send his lictors and lead me to death.” 
 “Lead you to—how can you talk such rubbish? You must come. This is how the matter stands.
      There has been a good deal of disturbance in Rome. As the Gods love me! I do not know why it
      is, but the people like thee vastly, and the rumor has got about that thou wast about to be
      repudiated, and that raw-boned filly taken in your place. First there were murmurings, then
      pasquinades affixed to the statues of the august Domitian. Then bands of rioters passed under
      his windows howling out mocking songs and blasphemies against his majesty, and next they
      clustered in knots, and that Insula of Castor and Pollux is a nest of insubordination. In
      fact, return you must to quiet men’s minds. You know what a disturbance in Rome is, we have
      gone through several. By Jupiter! I shall never forget the rocking I went through that night
      of the Lectisternium. These sort of things are only unobjectionable when seen from a distance.
      But they
      leave a taste of blood behind them. When the riot is over, then come
      proscription; the delators have a fine time of it, and the rich and noble are made to suffer.” 
 “But, mother, let Julia do what she will, I care not.” 
 “Rome does. The Roman rabble will not have it so. You have been familiar with the base and
      vile multitude. Can’t think how you could do it! However, it has succeeded this time and
      turned out a good move, for the people are clamorous for your return. The Augustus is but
      recently proclaimed and allegiance is still fresh—and I believe his cousin Ursus has been at
      him to have you back so as to humor the public.” 
 “Yet, if I refuse to gratify him.” 
 “Then, my dear, of course, it will be a pity, and all that sort of thing; but they all do
      it, and it must be right. The Augustus would prefer not to use severity—but if severe he must
      be, he will put down this disturbance with a hand of iron. He bears no actor’s sword, the
      blade of which is innocuous. I will call in Messalinus. He will tell you more.” 
 She clapped her hands; in obedience to her order a slave went outside the villa, and
      presently returned with the blind man. 
 He entered, working his sharp nose about, and then made a cringing bow towards the wall—not
      knowing where stood Domitia. 
 “Catullus Messalinus,” said Duilia, “have the goodness to inform my daughter of the
      intentions of the Augustus relative to the rabble in the Insula of Castor and Pollux, whence
      all the agitation proceeds.” 
 “Madam,” said the blind informer, “my god-like prince has already given command to clear
      the streets
      by means of the prætorian swords. As to that herd in the block of Castor and
      Pollux, they are reserved for condign punishment, unless my dear lady return at once. They
      will all—men, women and children, be driven into the circus. There are a pair of British war
      chariots, with scythes affixed to the axles, and the green drivers will be commanded to hustle
      round the ring at full speed among this rebellious rabble, to trample them down, and mow them
      as barley with the scythes—till not one remains alive as a seed of disaffection. What I say
      is—if a thing has to be done, do it thoroughly. It is true kindness in the end. Of course some
      must suffer, and one may praise the Gods that in this case it is only the common people.” 
 “The common people,” gasped Domitia. 
 Her eyes were glazed with horror. She saw the Insula, its crowds of
      busy, kindly, happy people, so good to one another, so affectionate to Glyceria, so grateful
      to her for visiting among them. And it was she, she by winning their love who was
      bringing this punishment upon them. In their blind, foolish way, they had misconceived her
      flight, and in their blind and stupid way, had resented an imaginary wrong offered to her, and
      because of their generous championship—they must suffer. 
 With bursting heart, and with a scalding rush of tears over her cheeks, Domitia extended
      her hand to her mother:— 
 “I go back,” she said, “My people! my poor people, my dear people! It must be so.—For their
       sake—pro populo.” 
 On her return to Rome and the palace, Domitia did not see the Emperor, but he sent her
      notice to be prepared to appear with him in public at the opening of the Circensian Games that
      he gave to the people in honor of his accession to the principate. This was to take place on
      the morrow. The games began at an early hour and lasted all day, with an interruption for the
       cena or supper at two o’clock. 
 The Circus was close under the Palatine Hill and occupied the valley between it and the
      Aventine. The site has now been taken possession of for gas-works. 
 It was a long structure, with one end like a horseshoe, the other was straight, or rather
      diagonal, a contrivance to enable horses and chariots when starting abreast to have equal
      lengths to run, which would not have been the case had the end been drawn straight across the
      circus. 
 This end was dignified with two towers, with a central gate between them and four arched
      doors on each side closed with ornamental wooden gates. 
 The seats of the spectators rose in tiers on all sides, except that of the straight side,
      where above the great entrance was the seat of the director of the sports. On one side of the
      Circus near the winning post was the imperial box. 
 Down the middle of the course ran a wall with statues planted on it, but at each end was a
      peculiar structure; that near the winning post sustaining seven white balls like eggs, that at
      the other extremity supporting as many bronze dolphins. 
 Each race consisted of seven circuits of the course, and a servant of the management at
      each end attended to the number of rounds made, and as each concluded, an egg was removed at
      one end, and a dolphin turned round at the other. 
 There was a separate entrance, with waiting-room for the prince and his party. Domitia with
      her train arrived first, and remained in the waiting-room till his arrival. 
 She was dressed in blue, with gold woven into the garment, and her hair was tied up with
      blue. She looked very lovely, slender and delicate in color, with large earnest indigo eyes,
      the darkest blue points about her. The sadness of her expression could not be dissipated by
      forced smiles. 
 In the waiting-chamber she could hear the mutter of voices in the circus; all Rome would be
      there. As she had descended from the Palatine she had seen scarce a soul in the forum or the
      streets, save watchmen and beggars. 
 Now pealed the trumpets, and next moment the prince, attended by his lictors, and with his
      niece Julia at his side, entered. He scowled at Domitia, and beckoned her to approach, then,
      without another word he went out of the door into the Imperial box. Hitherto it had been
      customary for the Empress to sit with the Vestal Virgins. But Nero had broken this rule and
      Domitian, the more to emphasize his reconciliation
      with Domitia, so as to please the people, followed the example of Nero. 
 Domitia entered and moved to the seat on his right; Julia, that on his left. Behind them
      poured a glittering retinue of lictors and soldiers, officers of the guard, and officials of
      the city and chamberlains. At once the whole concourse stood, and thundering cheers with
      clapping of hands rose from the circus. The Emperor made a hasty, ungracious sign of
      acknowledgment and took his seat. 
 The applause, however, did not die away, it broke out afresh, in spurts of enthusiasm, and
      the name of the Empress was audible—whereupon the cheers were prolonged with immense
      vehemence. 
 Domitian heard it. His brow darkened and his face flushed blood-red. He made a signal with
      his hand, at once three priests attended by men bearing pick and shovel entered the course,
      and directed their way to the end of the dividing wall or spine; there they threw up the soil,
      till a buried altar was reached, on which at once burning coals were placed, and all the
      concourse rose whilst incense and a libation and prayers were offered to the God Consus. 
 That ended, the fire was extinguished by the earth being thrown over it. Again the altar
      was buried, and the soil stamped above it. 
 This ceremony was hardly complete before the great central gates were thrown open, to a
      peal of trumpets, and heralds entered to proclaim the opening of the sports given by the
      Emperor, the Cæsar Domitian, the Augustus, son of the God Vespasian, high priest, holder of
      the tribunician power, consul, perpetual Censor, and father of his country; sports given for
      the
      pleasure of his well-beloved, the citizens of Rome, senators, knights, and people
      generally, and of such strangers as might at the time be in Rome, the centre of the world. 
 Again rose a roar of approbation, men stood up, stamped, jumped on their seats, and clapped
      their hands. 
 Then through the Triumphal Gate came the Circensian procession. This was properly a
      ceremonial of the 13th September; but in honor of the proclamation of the accession of
      Domitian to the throne, and to his giving the shows at his own charge, it was now again
      produced. 
 First came boys on horseback and on foot, gayly clothed, and immediately behind them the
      jockeys and runners who were to take part in the games. The racers were divided into four
      classes, each wearing the color of one season of the year. Green stood for spring, red for
      summer, blue for autumn, and white for winter. The riders and drivers were dressed according
      to the class to which they belonged. The chariots were drawn by four horses abreast, and each
      furnished with an outrider in the same colors, armed with a whip. At once cries rose from all
      sides, for every jockey and every horse was known by name, some cheered the drivers, some
      shouted the names of the horses, some proposed bets and others booked such as they had made. 
 Then came huntsmen with hounds, armed with lances, and behind them dancing soldiers, who
      clashed shields and swords in rhythm, accompanying their dance with choric song. 
 Next entered a set of men dressed in sheep’s and
      goats’ skins, and with fluttering ribbons, and lastly images of the gods on
      biers. The “pomp,” though a quaint and pretty sight, was looked on with some impatience, as
      wanting in novelty, and as but a prelude to the more exciting races. 
 The procession having made the circuit of the arena, retired, and with great rapidity the
      first four racing chariots were got into their caveæ, the vaults on the
      right side of the entrance with four doors opening on to the circus. 
 And now a chalked line was rapidly stretched across the course in front of the gates. A
      trumpet sounded, the gates were thrown open and the four chariots issued forth and were drawn
      up abreast behind the line, and lots cast to determine their positions. 
 Then Domitian stretching forth his hand, threw a white napkin into the arena, the white
      cord fell, and instantly the chariots started. 
 The spectators swayed and quivered, shouted and roared, women waved their veils, men
      clashed potsherds; some yelled out bets, and one or two from behind stumbled forward and fell
      among the occupants of the benches in front. 
 At the further end, where the circus described a horseshoe, a gallery of wood projected
      over the heads of those on the lower stages, to accommodate still more spectators; and these
      hammering on the boards with feet and fists greatly increased the din. 
 The roar of voices rolled like a wave along the right side of the circus, then broke into a
      billow at the curved end, and then surged down to the further extremity, again to swell and
      run and revolve, as an egg was dismounted, and a dolphin turned. 
 At each end of the spine, detached from it, were three obelisks, or conical masses of
      stone, sculptured like clipped yew trees. These were the Metæ. 
 Attending every charioteer was, as already said, an outrider in his colors, to lash the
      horses, and to assist in case of accident. Moreover, boys stood about with pitchers of water,
      to dash over the axles of the wheels when they became heated, or to wash away blood stains,
      should there be an accident. 
 Domitia sat watching the race, at first with inattention. Yet the general excitement was
      irresistible, it caught and carried her out of herself, and the color mounted into her ivory
      cheek. 
 The Emperor paid no attention to her, he studiously avoided speaking to her, and addressed
      his conversation to Julia alone—who was constrained to be present notwithstanding that the
      execution of her husband had taken place but a few days previously. But her heavy face gave no
      indication of acute sorrow. It was due to her position and relationship to the prince to be
      there, and when he commanded her attendance, it did not occur to her to show opposition. 
 The keenest rivalry existed between the parties of the circus, at a time when
      political partisanship was dangerous except to the sycophants of the regnant prince, all
      faction feeling was concentrated on the colors of the race-course. Caligula had championed the
      green, so had Nero, who had even strewn the course with green sand when he himself, in a green
      suit, had driven on it. And now Domitian accepted the green as the color that it comported
      with the dignity of his parvenu dynasty to favor. It was also generally
      preferred to the other, at any rate in the betting, be
      cause it was known that the Imperial favorites were allowed to win the majority
      of the races. 
 Yet the jockeys and horses and chariots belonged to different and rival companies, and were
      hired by the givers of games. It was not in the interest of the other colors to be beaten too
      frequently. They therefore arranged among themselves how many and which races were, as a
      matter of course, to be won by the green, and the rest of the races were open to be fairly
      contested. But the public generally were not let into the secret; though indeed the secret was
      usually sold to a few book-makers. 
 Hah! down went the red. In turning the metæ at the further end, the
      wheel had caught in that of the white, throwing the latter out, but not upsetting the chariot,
      whereas the car of the red jockey overturned, one horse went down, sprang up again, and would
      have dragged the driver along, had he not dextrously whipped a curved knife out of his girdle
      and cut the reins. This was necessary, as the reins of all four horses were thrown over the
      shoulder and wrapped round the body. Consequently a fall was certain to be fatal unless the
      driver had time and presence of mind at once to shear through the leathers. 
 “He is out! the red is out!” roared the mob. Then, “The white! the white is lagging—he
      cannot catch up!—the red did for him? Out of the way! Out ye two! ye cumber the course.” 
 The white struggled on, driver and outrider lashed the steeds, they strained every muscle,
      but there was no recovering from the loss of time caused by the lock of wheels, and on
      reaching the doors on the right, which were at once swung open, both chariots retreated into
      the caveæ, amidst the groans of such as had bets on their
      favor. 
 “It lies now between green and blue!” was the general shout. “On with the Panfaracus!”
      “Nay! hit the off horse, he sulks, Euprepes!” “Well done, Nereus! Pull well, Auster! Brave
      horses! brave greens! greens for ever! The Gods befriend the greens!” 
 Then some one looking in the direction of the imperial box noticed Domitia in her blue
      habit, with her blue eyes wide distended, and the blue ribbons in her hair. Suddenly in a
      clear voice he cried,— 
 “The blue! the blue! It is the color of the Augusta! The blue! Sabaste! I swear by her
      divinity! I invoke her aid! The blue will win.” 
 Like an electric shock there went a throb through the vast concourse—there were nearly
      three hundred thousand persons present. At once there rose a roar, it was loud, thrilling,
      imperious:— 
 “The blue! It shall win! The color of the Augusta! of the divine Augusta, the friend of the
      Roman people! The blue! the blue! we will have the blue!” 
 The drivers lashed furiously, the outriders swung themselves in their saddles to beat the
      horses. But the gallant steeds needed no scourging, they were as keen in their rivalry as were
      their drivers and their supporters. 
 “The last egg! the last dolphin! Again! the green is ahead!” a groan broken by only a few
      cheers. Wonderful! In the sudden contagion even those who had betted on the green, cheered the
      rival color. 
 “Who was that cried out for the blue?” asked
      Domitian, turning sharply about. “Find him, cast him to the dogs to be torn.”
     
 His kinsman Ursus whispered in his ear,— 
 “It is the actor Paris. Yet do nothing now. It would be inauspicious.” 
 The command was grudgingly withdrawn. 
 A gasp—stillness, the extreme meta had been turned; then a restless,
      quivering sound, men, women, too agitated to shout, held their breath, but muttered and moved
      their feet—the blue! the blue gains; nay! the green is forging ahead—Ha! Ha! at the last
      moment in swung the blue, across the white line, one stride ahead of the green. 
 Then there rolled up a thunder of applause. 
 “The blue! the dear blue! the blue of the Augusta has it! Ye Gods be praised! I vow a pig
      to Eppona! The blue has it. All hail to the Augusta! to heaven’s blue!” 
 Domitian turned with a look of hate at his wife, and whispered:— 
 Nevertheless she shall come in second. 
 “Come now!” said the Emperor, rising from his seat; “it is time that we should eat. My lady
      Longina, may it please you to sup with us?” 
 There was a malevolent glance in his pale watery eye. But Domitia did not see it, she
      looked at him as little as might be. 
 She rose at once. So also did Julia, the daughter of Titus, and the Emperor and his train
      left the circus; but as they withdrew there rose ringing cheers, the people standing on their
      benches and applauding—not the Cæsar, the Augustus, the Imperator—but her, Domitia, the blue.
      The people’s own true blue. He heard it, and ground his teeth—his face waxed red as blood.
      Domitia heard it, and her heart filled and her eyes brimmed with tears. 
 Then Domitian turned and looked at her savagely, as a dog might look at another against
      which it was meditating an onslaught, and said:— 
 “Remove that blue—I hate it, and come to the banquet.” Then with an ugly leer—“I have sent
      for the actor to amuse you.” 
 “What actor?” 
 “Paris, madam, the inimitable, the admired Paris, that he may recite from Greek plays to
      our pleasure. These Greek tragedians are at a discount. Our people do not care for the
      dismals. But they are wrong, do
      not estimate true art. You do that really! You like tragedy! and tragedy you
      shall have, I warrant you.” 
 The blood mounted to the brow of Domitia at the sneers and covert insinuations. Paris! what
      was Paris to her? what but the struggling husband of Glyceria? Was it impossible for her to do
      a kind act, to give expansion to her heart, without misinterpretation, without the certainty
      of incurring outrage? 
 She withdrew to her apartments and changed her dress, from the blue to white with purple
      stripe and fringes. Then she entered the triclinium where the meal was
      spread. 
 Domitian was already there, together with Julia, Messalinus, Ursus, and some other friends.
      The Emperor, standing apart from the latter, said with a sneer to Domitia,— 
 “So you have shed your blue—a cloud has passed over the azure! That is well. And now,
      madam, I granted you the first place at the games, in the circus, to humor the people; but in
      my palace it shall be as I will, not as they. Julia shall take the precedence, and she shall
      occupy the first position at table, and everywhere. She is the daughter of the God Titus,
      granddaughter of the God Vespasian-” 
 “And great grand-daughter of the Commissioner of Nuisances.” 
 “Silence,” roared Domitian, “she has the sacred Flavian blood, she is of Divine race, and
      shall sit by me, recline by me, in the position of honor, and you occupy a stool at my feet.
      Julia and I will have a lectisternium of the Gods! Am not I divine?—and she divine?” 
 “Certainly,” answered Domitia, “she is the daughter of a victor who has triumphed, I the
      wife of a man who
      will filch laurels from his generals, and himself has never seen a battle.” 
 Domitian clenched his teeth and hands, and glared at her. 
 “I wish to the Gods I could find it in my heart to have thee strangled, thou demon cat.” 
 “I can understand that, having let out the divine blood of the Flavii from the throat of
      your cousin Sabinus, you would stoop to me.” 
 “What—what—what is this?” exclaimed Messalinus, thrusting his pointed face in the direction
      of the prince and Domitia; he scented an altercation. 
 As for her—she wondered at herself, having the courage to defy the Lord of the World. She
      could not keep down the disgust, the hatred she felt for the man who had wrecked her life, it
      must out, and she valued not her life sufficiently to deny herself the gratification of
      throwing off her mind the taunts that rose in it, and lodged on her tongue. 
 Domitian signed to table—Julia, with a flutter of clumsy timidity, shrank from the place of
      honor, and looked hesitatingly at her sister-in-law, who without a word seated herself on the
      stool indicated by the Emperor. There was no vulgar pride, no ambition in the daughter of
      Titus. 
 The guests looked at each other, as Julia was forced by the command of her uncle to recline
      on the couch properly belonging to his wife, and whispered to each other. 
 “What, what? Who is where?” asked the ferret-faced Messalinus. “What has been done? Here,
      Lycus,” to a slave, who always attended him, “Tell me, what has been done. In my ear, quick, I
      burn to know.” 
 Something was communicated in an undertone, and
      Messalinus broke into a cackle, that he quickly smothered— 
 “That is admirable, great and god-like is our prince! As a Jew physician said to me, he
      sets down one and setteth up another, at his pleasure. That is divine caprice. The Gods alone
      can act without having to account for what they do. I like it—vastly.” 
 And now at once the sycophant herd began to pay their addresses to Julia, and to neglect
      Domitia. The former was overloaded with flattery, her every word was repeated, passed on from
      one to another, as though oracular. Domitian, conspicuously and purposely ignored his wife
      made to sit at his feet; and raising himself on the left elbow upon his
        pulvinar, or cushion of gold brocade, talked with his niece,
      who also reclined instead of sitting. 
 Domitia remained silent with lowered eyes, carnations flowered in her cheeks. She made no
      attempt to speak; eat she could not. She felt the slight. Her pride was cut to the quick. The
      humiliation, before such as Messalinus was numbing. She would have endured being ordered to
      execution, she would have arranged her hair with alacrity, for the bowstring that would have
      finished her troubles, but this outrage before members of the court, before the imperial
      slaves,—and the knowledge that it would be the talk on the morrow of Roman society, covered
      her with confusion, and filled her soul with wrath, for she had pride—not a little. 
 Ursus, a kinsman of the Emperor, an elderly man, of good character and upright walk, was
      near her. He alone seemed to feel the indignity put upon the Empress. His eyes, full of pity,
      rested on her, and he waited
      an opportunity to speak to her unheard by others. Then he said, turning his head
      towards Domitia,— 
 “Lady, recall the fable of the oak and the bulrush. Humor the prince and you can do with
      him what you will. Believe me, and I speak sincerely,—he loves you still, loves you madly—but
      you repel him and that offends his pride. All things are his, in earth,—I may almost say in
      heaven—and he cannot endure that one frail woman’s heart should alone be denied him.” 
 “There are certain waters,” answered Domitia, “that turn to stone whatever is exposed to
      them—even a bird’s feather. It is as though I had been subjected to this treatment. My heart
      is petrified.” 
 “Not so, dear lady, it beats at the present moment with anger. It can also beat with love.” 
 “Never towards him who has maltreated me.” 
 “By the Gods! forbear. I am endangered by listening to such words.” 
 “What—what—what is Ursus saying?” asked Messalinus, who caught a word or two. “He is beside
      the Augusta—what did he say—and in a low tone also. No treason hatching at the table of our
      Divine Lord, I trust.”
     
 “Here come the jesters and the mimes,” said Ursus, “and may the god of Laughter provide
      such matter for mirth as will satisfy Catullus Messalinus.” 
 “Then it must be a tragedy,” said another guest, “for to our blind friend here, naught is
      jocose unless to some other it be painful.” 
 “We have all our gifts,” said Messalinus, smirking. 
 Then entered some acrobats who went through
      evolutions, casting knives and catching them, forming human pyramids, ladders,
      wheels, balancing poles on their chins whilst a boy went through contortions at the top. 
 But there was no novelty in the exhibition. The Emperor wearied of it, and ordered the
      performers to withdraw. 
 Next appeared mimes, who performed low buffoonery in gesture and dialogue, interspersed
      with snatches of song, that were so offensive to decency that Domitia, who had never seen and
      heard anything of the kind at her mother’s house, sprang to her feet with flaming cheeks, brow
      and bosom, and made a motion to leave. She knew it—this disgusting performance had been
      commanded by the prince, for the purpose of humiliating her. She would go. But Domitian, whose
      malignant glance was on her, saw her purpose and called out,— 
 “It is my will, Domitia, that you remain in your seat. The cream of the entertainment has
      yet to come.” 
 Ursus put his hand to her garment and gently drew her down on her seat. 
 “Endure it,” he whispered, “it will soon be over.” 
 “It is the worst outrage of all,” said she with heaving breast, and the blood so surged
      into her eyes and ears that she could see and hear no more. 
 Indeed, she was hardly conscious when the buffoons withdrew, her eyes rested on the marble
      floor, strewn with the remains of the feast. But suddenly she
      started from the dream, or the stupefaction into which
      she had fallen, by hearing the voice of Paris, the tragic actor. 
 She looked up sharply, and saw him, a tall, handsome man, of Greek profile, and with curly
      dark hair. He was clad in a long mantle, and wore the buskins. Behind him were minor
      performers, to take a part in dialogue, or to chant a chorus. 
 “Lord and Augustus, what is it your pleasure that we represent in your presence?” asked the
      actor. 
 “Repeat the speech of Œdipus Coloneus to Theseus towards the close of the drama. That, I
      mean, which begins, “O son of Ægeus, I will teach the things that are in
       store.”” 
 Paris bowed, and drawing himself up, closing his eyes to represent the blindness of the old
      king he personated, and with hands extended began: 
 “Do you mark, Domitia?” called the Emperor with bantering tone. 
 “I have looked under the table, sire, to see whether, like your kinsman Calvisius, you keep
      there a prompter who has read Eurypides.”
     
 Some of the guests hardly controlled their laughter. The deficiency in the education of
      Domitian was well known. 
 “Go on, fellow,” ordered he surlily. “Skip some lines—it is tedious, draw to the end.” 
 Paris resumed:— 
 Then the chorus, in rhythmic dance sang:— 
 “Enough,” said Domitian, and waved his hand. “How likest thou that, Domitia?” 
 “Methinks, sire, the words are ominous. Suffer me I pray thee to retire—for I
      am not well.” 
 As she rose, she looked at Paris. Their eyes met, and at once a horror—a premonition of
      evil fell on her, and turned her blood to ice. 
 He raised his hand to his lips and said in a low tone as she passed him:— 
 “Morituri te salutant.” 
 “I’ faith it is an excellent jest!” said Messalinus—“I relish it vastly.” 
 Domitia returned to her apartments, quivering like an aspen in a light air; but no sooner
      was she there, than she summoned Eboracus, and said to him:— 
 “Be speedy. Follow Paris, and protect him. There is evil planned against him. Fly—lest you
      be too late.” 
 The slave departed at once. 
 Domitia paced the room, in an agony of mind, now shivering with cold, then with face
      burning. But it was not the humiliations to which she had been subjected that so affected
      her,—it was fear of what she suspected was meditated against the actor, and through him
      against Glyceria. 
 A cold sweat broke out on her brow, and icy tears formed on her long eyelashes. It seemed
      to her that for her to show favor to any one, was to bring destruction on that person. And
      hatred towards the Emperor became in her heart more intense and bitter. 
 She could think of nothing else but the danger that menaced Paris. She went out on the
      terrace, and the wind blowing over her moist brow chilled her; she drew her mantle more
      closely around her, and re-entered the palace. Already night was falling, for the days were
      becoming short. 
 Her heart cried out for something to which to cling,
      for some one to whom to appeal against the overwhelming evil and tyranny that
      prevailed. 
 Was there no power in earth above the Cæsar? There was none. No power in heaven? She could
      not tell; all there was dark and doubtful. There was a Nemesis—but slow of step, and only
      overtaking the evil-doer when too late to prevent the misery he wrought, sometimes so lagging
      as not to catch him at all, and so blind as often to strike the innocent in place of the
      guilty. No cry of the sufferer could reach this torpid Nemesis and rouse her to quicker
      action. She was a deity bungling, deaf and blind. 
 Again she tramped up and down the room. She could endure to have no one with her. She sent
      all her servants away. 
 But the air within was stifling. She could not breathe, the ceiling came down on her head,
      and again she went forth. 
 Now she could hear voices below in the Sacred Way. She could see lights, coming from
      several quarters, and drawing together to one point where they formed a cluster, and from this
      point rose a wail—the wail of the dead. 
 She wiped her brow. She was sick at heart, and again went within, and found Eboracus there,
      cast down and silent. 
 “Speak,” she said hoarsely. 
 “It was too late. He had been stabbed in the back, whilst leaving the palace, and a pupil
      was assassinated at the same time, because somewhat resembling him.” 
 Domitia stood cold as marble. She covered her mouth for a moment with her right hand, and
      then in a hard voice said:— 
 “Inform Euphrosyne. I cannot.” 
 Then she turned away, went to her bed-chamber, and was seen of none again that night.
      Several of her female slaves sought admission to undress her, but were somewhat roughly
      dismissed. 
 In that long night, Domitia felt as one drowning in a dark sea. She stretched out her hands
      to lay hold of something—to stay her up, and found nothing. She had nothing to look forward
      to, no shore to which she might attain by swimming, nothing to care for, nothing to cling to.
      There was no light above, only the unsympathetic stars that looked down on the evil there was,
      the wrong that was done, and cared not. The pulsation of their light was not quickened by
      sense of injustice, they did not veil their rays so as to hide from them the horrors committed
      on earth. There was no light below, save the reflection of the same passionless eyes of
      heaven. 
 She felt as though she were still capable of the sense of pain, but not of being sensible
      to pleasure. 
 The faculty of being happy was gone from her forever, and life presented to her a prospect
      of nothing better than gray tracts of monotonous existence, seamed with earthquake chasms of
      suffering. 
 Next day she rose white and self-restrained, she summoned to her Euphrosyne, but did not
      look at her tear-reddened eyes. 
 “Euphrosyne,” said she, “I bid you go, and take with you Eboracus, I place you both wholly
      at the disposal of your sister—and bid her spare no cost, but give to him who has been, a
      splendid funeral at my expense. Here is money. And—” she paused a moment to obtain mastery
      over herself, as her emotion
      threatened to get the upper hand—“and, Euphrosyne, tell Glyceria that I shall go
      to see her later. Not for a few days, not till the first agony of her grief is over; but go I
      will—for go I must—and I pray the Gods I may not be a cause of fresh evil. O, Euphrosyne, does
      she curse me?” 
 “Glyceria curses none, dear mistress, least of all you. Do not doubt, she will welcome you
      when you do her the honor of a visit.” 
 “If she were to curse me, I feel as if I should be glad—glad, too, if the curse fell heavy
      on my head—but you know—she knows—I meant to do well, to be kind—to—but go your way—I can
      speak no more. Tell Glyceria not to curse me—no—I could not bear that—not a curse from her.” 
 Euphrosyne saw by her mistress’s manner, by her contradictory words, how deeply she was
      moved, how great was her suffering. She stooped, took up the hem of her garment, and kissed
      the purple fringe. Then sobbing, withdrew. 
 That day tidings came to Domitia to render her pain more acute. 
 The kindly, sympathetic people in the insula of Castor and Pollux, in
      poetic, picturesque fashion had come with baskets of violets and late roses, and had strewn
      with the flowers the spot stained with the blood of Paris. 
 This was reported to the Emperor, and he sent his guards down the street to disperse the
      people, and in doing this, they employed their swords, wounding several and killing two or
      three, of whom one was a child. 
 Three days later, Domitia ordered her litter and at
      tendants that she might go to the Insula in the Suburra. 
 She had said nothing of her intentions, or probably Domitian would have heard of them—she
      was surrounded by spies who reported in his ear whatever she did—and he would have forbidden
      the visit. 
 Only when the Forum had been crossed, did she instruct the bearers as to the object of her
      excursion. 
 On entering the block of lodgings and ascending the stairs Domitia was received with
      respect but with some restraint. The people did not press about her with enthusiasm as before;
      they knew that it was through her that evil had overtaken them, and they dreaded her visit as
      inauspicious. 
 Yet there was no look of resentment in any face, only timorous glances, and reverential
      bows, and salutations with the hand to the lips. The poor folk knew full well that it was
      through no ill-will on her part that Paris and his pupil, and some of their own party had
      fallen. 
 It was already bruited about that Julia daughter of Titus was honored in the palace, and
      advanced above Domitia, the Empress. Some said that Domitian would repudiate his wife, that he
      might marry his niece, and that he waited only till the months of mourning for her husband
      were passed, so as not to produce a scandal. Others said that he would not repudiate Domitia,
      but treat her as Nero had treated Octavia, trump up false charges against her and then put her
      to death. 
 Already Domitia was regarded as unlucky, and on the matter of luck attaching to or
      deserting certain persons, the Roman populace were vastly superstitious. 
 And now, although these poor creatures loved the beautiful woman of imperial rank who
      deigned to come among them, and care for one of their most broken and bruised members, yet
      they feared for themselves, lest her presence should again draw disaster upon them. 
 Domitia was conscious rather than observant of this as she passed along the gallery to the
      apartment of Glyceria. 
 At the door to the poor woman’s lodgings she knocked, and in response to a call, opened and
      entered. She waved her attendants to remain without and suffer none to enter. 
 Then she approached the bed of the sick woman, hastily, and threw herself on her knees
      beside it. 
 “Glyceria,” she said, “can you forgive me?” 
 The crippled woman took the hands of Domitia and covered them with kisses, whilst her tears
      flowed over them. 
 This was more than the Empress could bear. She disengaged her hands, threw her arms about
      the widow, and burst into convulsive weeping. 
 “Nay, nay!” said Glyceria, “do not give way. It was not thy doing.” 
 “But you fear me,” sobbed Domitia, “they do so—they without. Not one touched, not one
      kissed me. They think me of evil omen.” 
 “There is nothing unlucky. Everything falls out as God wills; and whatever comes, if we bow
      under His hand, He will give sweetness and grace.” 
 “You say this! You who have lost everything!” 
 “Oh, no! lady,” then the cripple touched the cornelian fish. “This remains.” 
 “It is a charm that has brought no luck.” 
 “It is no charm. It is a symbol—and to you dark. To me full of light and joy in believing.” 
 “I cannot understand.” 
 “No—that I know full well. But to one who does, there is comfort in every sorrow, a rainbow
      in every cloud, roses to every thorn.” 
 “Glyceria,” said Domitia, and she reared herself upon her knees, and took hold of both the
      poor woman’s hands; so that the two, with tear-stained cheeks, looked each other full in the
      face. “My Glyceria! wilt thou grant me one favor?” 
 “I will give thee, lady, anything that thou canst ask. I should be ungrateful to deny thee
      ought.” 
 “It is a great matter, a sharp wrench I ask of thee,” said the daughter of Corbulo. 
 “I will do all that I can,” replied the widow. 
 “Then come with me to the palace. Here you have none to care for you, none to earn a
      livelihood for you,—I want you there.” 
 Glyceria hesitated. 
 “Do you fear?” 
 “I fear nothing for myself.” 
 “Nor I,” said Domitia. “Oh, Glyceria, I am the most miserable woman on earth. I thought I
      could not be more unhappy than I was—then come—I will not speak of it,—thy loss—caused
      unwillingly by me, because I came here—and that has broken my heart. I have done the cruellest
      hurt to the one I loved best. I am most miserable—most miserable.” She covered her face, sank
      on the bed and wept. 
 The widow of the player endeavored to soothe her with soft words and caresses. 
 Then again Domitia spoke. “I have no one, I have
      nothing to look to, I am as one dead, and the only life in me is hate, that bites
      and writhes as a serpent.” 
 “And that thou must lay hold of and strangle as did Hercules.” 
 “I cannot, and I will not.” 
 “That will bring thee only greater suffering.” 
 “I cannot suffer more.” 
 “It is against the will of God.” 
 “But how know we His will?” 
 “It has been revealed.” 
 Again Domitia threw her arms about the sick woman, she pressed her wet cheek to her
      tear-moistened face, and said:— 
 “Come with me, and tell me all thou knowest—and about the Fish. Come with me, and give me a
      little happiness, that I may think of thee, comfort thee, read to thee, talk with thee—I care
      for no other woman. And Euphrosyne, thy sister, she is with me, and I will keep thee as the
      apple of mine eye.” 
 “Oh, lady! this is too great!” 
 “What? anon thou wouldst deny me naught, and now refusest me this.” 
 “In God’s name so be it,” said Glyceria. “But when?” 
 “Now. I will have no delay, see—” she went to the door and spoke with her slaves. “They
      shall bear thee in my litter, at once. Euphrosyne shall tarry here and collect thy little
      trifles, and the good Eboracus, he shall bear them to thy new home. O Glyceria! For once I see
      a sunbeam.” 
 Never could the dwellers in the Insula have dreamt of beholding that which this day they
      saw. The actor’s crippled widow lifted by imperial slaves and
      placed in the litter of the Empress, the Augusta, to whom divine honors had been
      accorded. And, further, they saw the cripple borne away, down the lane of the Suburra in which
      was their block of lodgings, and the Empress walked by the side, holding the hand of the
      patient who lay within. 
 They did not shout, they uttered no sound indicative of approval, no applause. They held
      their breaths, they laid their hands on their mouths, they looked each other in the eyes—and
      wondered what this marvel might portend. A waft of a new life had entered into the evil world,
      whence it came, they knew not, what it would effect, that also they could not conceive—whom it
      would touch, how transform, all was hid from their eyes. 
 No notice was taken by Domitian of the presence in the palace of the murdered actor’s
      widow. It concerned him in no way, and he allowed the unfortunate woman to remain there, under
      the care of his wife, and without making any protest. 
 Domitia found an interest and a delight in the society of the paralyzed woman, so simple in
      mind, gentle in thought, always cheerful, ever serene, who lived in an atmosphere of love and
      harbored no resentments. 
 She marvelled at what she saw, but it was to her an unattainable condition. Her own
      affections were seared, and a gnawing hate against the man who had blighted her life, and to
      whom she was tied, ever consumed her. 
 She was like a dead plant in the midst of spring vegetation. It looks down on the beautiful
      life about its feet, but itself puts forth no buds, shows no signs of mounting sap. 
 Every now and then Glyceria approached the topic of the Fish, and the mysteries involved in
      the symbol, but would not disclose them, for she saw that Domitia, however miserable she felt,
      however hopeless, was not in a frame of mind to receive and welcome the interpretation. For in
      her, the one dominating passion was
      hate—a desire to have her wrongs revenged, and a chafing at her powerlessness to
      do anything to revenge them. 
 Her treatment by Domitian was capricious. At one time he neglected her; then he went
      sometimes out of his way to offer her a slight; at others he made real efforts to heal the
      breach between them, and to show her that he loved her still. 
 But he met with not merely a frosty but a contemptuous reception, that sent him away, his
      vanity hurt, and his blood in a ferment. 
 In her indifference to life, she was able to brave him without fear, and he knew that if he
      ordered her to execution she would hail death as a welcome means of escape from association
      with himself. 
 His blundering and brutal tyranny was no match for her keen wit cutting into him, and
      maddening him. He revenged himself by a coarse insult or by a side blow at her friends. She
      was without ambition. Many a woman would have endured his treatment without repining, for the
      sake of the splendor with which she could surround herself, and the towering position which
      she occupied. But neither had any attraction for Domitia. The one thing she did desire, to be
      left alone in retirement, in the country, that he could not, he would not accord her. 
 Usually, when he was in his splendid villa at Albanum, she elected to remain in Rome, and
      when he came to the palace on the Palatine, if permitted, she escaped to Albanum; but he would
      not always suffer this. 
 Thus a wretched life was dragged on, and the heart of Domitia became harder every day. It
      would have become as adamant but for the presence of Glyceria,
      whom the Empress sincerely loved, and who exercised a subtle, softening and
      purifying influence on the princess. 
 Glyceria saw how the Empress suffered, and she pitied her, saw how hopeless the conditions
      were for improvement; she saw also what was hidden to other eyes, that circumstances were
      closing round and drawing towards a crisis. 
 Beyond a certain point Glyceria could effect nothing, once only did she dare to suggest
      that the Augusta should assume a gentler demeanor towards the sovereign of the world, but she
      was at once cut back with the words:— 
 “There, Glyceria, I allow no interference. He has wronged me past endurance. I can never
      forgive. I have but one hope, I make but one prayer—and that for revenge.” 
 When Domitian was at Albanum, the Empress enjoyed greater freedom. She was not compelled
      when she went out, to journey in state; and she could make excursions into the country as she
      pleased. The absence of gardens on the Palatine and the throng of servants and officers made
      it an almost intolerable residence to her, beautiful as the situation was, and splendid as
      were the edifices on it. Nor was this all. Domitian had not rested content with the palaces
      already erected and crowding the summit of the rock,—those of Augustus, of Tiberius, and of
      Caligula, he must build one himself, and to find material, he tore down the golden house of
      Nero. 
 But the construction of his palace served still further to reduce the privacy of the
      Palatine, for it was thronged with masons, carpenters and plasterers. In
      deed the Palatine hill-top was almost as crowded and as noisy as was the Forum
      below. 
 From this, then, Domitia was glad to escape to a little villa on the Via Nomentana, on a
      height above the Anio, commanding a view of the Sacred Mount. 
 On one occasion, when Domitian was away at Albanum, she had been at this modest retreat,
      where she was surrounded by a few servants, and to which she had conveyed Glyceria, to enjoy
      the pure air and rest of the country. 
 But she was obliged to return to Rome; and with a small retinue, and without heralds
      preceding her, she started, and in the morning arrived at the Porta Collina. Then Eboracus,
      coming to the side of the litter, said:— 
 “Lady, there is a great crowd, and the street is full to choking. What is your good
      pleasure? shall we announce who you are, and command a passage?” 
 “Nay,” answered the princess, “my good Eboracus, let us draw aside, and the swarm will
      pass, then we can go our way unconcerned. I am in no precipitate haste, and, in faith, every
      minute I am outside Rome, the better satisfied am I.” 
 “But, madam, it is an ill spot, we are opposite the Accursed Field.” 
 “That matters not. It is but for a brief while. Go forward, Eboracus, and inquire what this
      crowd signifies. Methinks the people are marvellously still. I hear no shout, not even a
      murmur.” 
 “There be priests leading the way.” 
 “It is some religious rite. Run forward, Eboracus, and make inquiries. That boy bears an
      inverted torch.” 
 The sight was extraordinary. A procession of priests
      was advancing in silence, and an enormous crowd followed through the gate,
      pouring forth like water from a sluice, yet without a word spoken. The only sound was that of
      the tramp of feet. 
 The place where Domitia had halted was just outside the Collina gateway, where was the wall
      of Servius Tullius and in its moat, thirty feet deep, but dry, out of which rose the wall of
      massive blocks to another thirty above the level of the ground. 
 This ditch was a pestilential refuse place into which the carcasses of beasts, foul rags,
      sometimes even the bodies of men, and all the unmentionable filth of a great city were cast.
      So foul was the spot, so unwholesome the exhalations that no habitations were near it, and the
      wide open space before the wall went by the designation of the Accursed Field. 
 And now, through the gateway came a covered hearse, and at each corner walked a youth in
      mourning garb, one bearing a lamp and oil, another milk in a brass vessel, a third water, and
      a fourth bread. Now, and now only, with a shudder of horror, did Domitia suspect what was
      about to take place. She saw how that as the crowd deployed, it thickened about one portion of
      the bank of the ditch, and she saw also the battlements above crowded with the faces of men
      and women leaning over to look down into the dyke. And there, at one spot in the fosse stood
      three men. Instinctively Domitia knew who they were—the executioner and his assistants. 
 But who was to be put to death—and on what charge, and by what means? 
 Now the hearse was slowly brought to the edge of the moat and the curtains were raised. 
 Then Domitia saw how that within, prostrate, lay a woman, bound hand and foot to the posts
      by leather straps, with her face covered, and her mouth muffled that her cries might not be
      heard. 
 She saw the attendants of the priests untie the thongs and the unfortunate woman was raised
      to a sitting posture, yet still her face was veiled, and her hands were held by servants of
      the pontiff. Now one by one the attendants descended into the moat bearing the lamp and the
      bread and milk, and each handed what he had borne in the procession to the executioner, who
      gave each article as received to one of his deputies; and the man immediately disappeared with
      it. 
 Domitia’s heart beat furiously, she put forth her head to look, and discovered a hole at
      the base of the wall, and through this hole she discerned the twinkling light of the lamp as
      it passed within, then it was lost. The bread followed, the milk and the water, all conveyed
      into some underground cellar. 
 And now the chief pontiff present plucked the veil from the face of the victim, and with a
      gasp—she could not cry out, the power was taken from her—the Empress recognized Cornelia. 
 She made an effort to escape from her litter, and fly to her friend with outstretched arms,
      but Eboracus, who with white face had returned, caught and restrained her. 
 “Madam,” he said in a low tone, vibrating with emotion, “I pray you, for the sake of the
      Gods—do nothing rash. Stay where you are. No power—not that of the Sacred Twelve can save
      her.” 
 “Ye Gods! But what has she done?” 
 “She has been accused of breach of her vows, and
      condemned by the Augustus, as Chief Priest—” in a lower tone, hardly above a
      whisper, “unheard in her defence.” 
 “I must go to her.” 
 “You must not. Nothing can save her. Pray for a speedy death.” 
 With glazed eyes, with a surging in her ears, and throbbing in the temples—as in some
      paralyzing nightmare—Domitia looked on. 
 And now the gag was removed, and with dignity the Great Mother of the Vestals descended
      from the bier. She stood, tall and with nobility in her aspect, and looked round on the crowd,
      then down into the moat, at the black hole under the roots of the wall. 
 “Citizens, by the sacred fire of Vesta, I swear I am innocent of the charge laid against
      me, and for which I am sentenced. No witnesses have been called. I have not been suffered to
      offer any defence. I knew not, citizens, until I was told that I was sentenced, that any
      accusation had been trumped up against me. Thou, O Eternal God—above all lights in the
      firmament, Thou, O Sovereign Justice that holdest true balances—I invoke Thee—I summon the
      Chief Pontiff who has sentenced me, before your just thrones, to answer for what is done unto
      me this day. I summon him for midnight three days hence.” 
 Then the deputy of the Chief Pontiff, who presided at the execution, Domitian being absent
      at Albanum (he being Pontifex Maximus), raised his arms to heaven in silent prayer. 
 His prayer ended, he extended his hand to Cornelia, but she refusing his help, unaided
      descended into the fosse. 
 The vast concourse was as though turned to stone by a magician’s wand—so immovable was it
      and so hushed. Some swallows swept screaming along the moat, and their shrill cries sent a
      shudder through the entire concourse, wrought to such a tension, that even the note of the
      birds was an intolerable addition. 
 The Vestal reached the mouth of the pit—the ends of a ladder could be seen at the threshold
      of this opening. It was evident that the opening gave access to a vault of some depth. 
 Beside it were stones from the wall piled up, and mortar. As soon as the Abbess reached the
      opening, she turned, and again declared her innocence. “The Emperor,” said she in clear, firm
      tones, “has adjudged me guilty, knowing that my prayers have obtained for him victory, triumph
      and an immortal name. I repeat my summons. I bid him answer before the throne on high, at
      midnight, three days hence.” 
 Then she looked steadily at the blue sky—then up at the sun,—to take a last view of light.
      With calmness, with fortitude, she turned, and entering the opening began to disappear,
      descending the ladder. 
 In so doing her veil caught in one of the ends of the side poles of the ladder. She must
      have reascended a step or two, for her hand was visible disengaging the white veil, and
      then—hand and veil disappeared. 
 Immediately stones were caught up, trowels and mortar seized, and with incredible celerity
      the opening was walled up. The pontiff applied his leaden seal. 
 “Be speedy! Remove her! Run—” shouted Eboracus, for his mistress had fallen back in the
      litter in a dead faint,—“At once—to the Palace!” 
 Eboracus was able to open a way for the litter through the crowd, now clustered on the bank
      of the dyke, watching as the workmen threw down earth and stones, and buried deep that portion
      of the wall in which was the vault where the unhappy Abbess Cornelia was buried alive. And now
      the populace broke forth in sighs and tears, and in murmurings low expressed at the injustice
      committed in sentencing a woman without allowing her to know that she had been accused, and of
      saying a word in her own defence. Some of the crowd was drifting back into Rome, and by
      entering this current, the train of Domitia travelled along. 
 Eboracus returned from the head of the litter repeatedly to the side, to look within and
      ascertain whether his mistress were recovering. At the first fountain he stopped the convoy
      and obtained for her water to bathe her face, and at a little tavern, he procured strong
      Campanian wine, which he entreated her to sip, so as to nerve her. 
 As the litter approached the Forum, the crowd again coagulated and at last remained
      completely stationary. Again the street was blocked. 
 Eboracus went forward and forced his way through, that he might ascertain the cause, and
      whether the
      block was temporary and would speedily cease. He came back in great agitation,
      and said hastily to his mistress:— 
 “Lady, you cannot proceed. Suffer me to recommend that you go to the Carinæ and tarry
      there—with your lady mother for a while, till your strength is restored, and till the streets
      be more open.” 
 “Eboracus—what is going on? tell me.” 
 “Madam, there is something being transacted in the comitium that causes
      all the approaches to be packed with people. We might make a circuit—but, lady! I think if you
      would deign to repose for an hour at your mother’s house, after what you have suffered, it
      would be advisable.” 
 “Tell me what is taking place in the comitium.” 
 “I should prefer, lady, not to be asked.” 
 “But I have asked.” 
 “Then, dear mistress, do not require of me to make answer.” 
 “Answer truly. Tell me no lie. What is it?” 
 He hesitated. Then Domitia said:— 
 “Look at my hand, it is firm, it does not tremble. Nothing that I hear can be worse than
      what I have seen.” 
 “Lady—your strength has already failed.” 
 “And now I have gathered my resolution together, and can bear anything. I adjure you, by
      your duty to me—answer me, what is taking place in the comitium, what is it
      that causes the streets leading thereto to be impassable.” 
 “If I must reply——” 
 “If you do not, I will have you scourged.” 
 “Nay, lady, that is not like thee. It is not fear that
      will make me speak, but because I know that if I do not, the information can be
      got from another.” 
 “Well—what is it?” 
 “The knight Celer, on the same charge as that which lost the Great Mother Cornelia, is
      being whipped to death with the scorpion.”
     
 “By the same orders? To my mother’s in the Carinæ.” 
 Hastily Domitia drew the curtains of her litter, and was seen no more, spoke no more till
      she reached the door of Longa Duilia. 
 Here she descended and entered the house. 
 “My dear Domitia! my august daughter! What a pleasure! What an honor!” 
 The lady Duilia started up to embrace the Empress. 
 Domitia received the kiss coldly, and sank silent on a stool. 
 Her mother looked at her with surprise. Domitia was waxen white, her eyes with dark rings
      about them, and unnaturally large and bright. The color had left her lips and these were
      leaden in hue. 
 Domitia did not speak, did not move. She remained for some moments like a statue. 
 “As the Gods love me!” exclaimed her mother after a long pause, “you are not going to be
      ill, surely—nothing dangerous, nothing likely to end unhappily. Ye Gods! and I have so much I
      want you to do for me. Tell me, I entreat you. Hide nothing from me. You are suffering. Where
      is it? What is it? Shall I send for a doctor?” 
 “Mother, no doctor can cure me. It is here,” Domitia pressed her hands to her heart—“and
      here,”
      to her temples. “I am the most miserable, the most unfortunate of women.” 
 “Ye Gods! He has divorced you?” 
 “No, mother. I would that he had.” 
 “Then what is the matter? Have you eaten what disagrees with you? As the Gods love me! you
      should not come out such a figure. Who was your face-dresser to-day? she ought to be
      crucified! Not a particle of paint—white as ivory. Intolerable—and it has given me such a
      turn.” 
 Domitia made no reply. 
 “But what is it? What has made you look like Parian marble?” 
 “The Great Mother Cornelia—” Domitia could say no more, a lump rose in her throat and
      choked her. Then all at once she began to shiver as though frost-stricken and her teeth
      chattered. 
 “I have an essence—you must take that,” said the lady Duilia. “My dear, I know
      all about that. An estimable lady. I mean she was so till the Augustus decreed otherwise. I am
      sorry, and all that—but you know—well, these things do happen and must, and I dare be bound
      that some are glad, as it makes an opening for another needy girl, of good family of course.
      What is one person’s loss is another’s gain. The world is so and we can’t alter it, and a good
      thing, I say, that it is so.” 
 “Mother—she was innocent.” 
 “Well, well, we know all about that. Of course it was all nonsense what was charged against
      her, that we quite understand. It would never have done for the real truth to have been
      advertised.” 
 “And what was the truth?” 
 “My dear Domitia! How can you ask such a silly, infantile question? It was your doing, you
      must understand that. You threw yourself on her protection, embraced the altar of Vesta, and
      Cornelia with the assistance of Celer did what she could to further your object in leaving
      Rome. If people will do donkey-like things they must get a stick across their backs. It is so,
      and always will be so in this world, and we cannot make it otherwise.” 
 “I thought so. I was sure it was so,” said Domitia gravely. There was an infinity of
      sadness, of despair in her tone. “Mother, I bring misfortune upon all with whom I have to do.” 
 “Ye Gods! not on me! I hope to be preserved from that! Do not speak such unlucky words—they
      are of bad omen.” 
 “I cannot help it, mother, it is true. I am the most unfortunate of women myself——” 
 “You speak rank folly. Ye Gods forgive me! saying such a thing to one who is herself
      divine. But, it is so—you are positively the most fortunate of women. What more do you desire?
      You are the Augusta, the people swear by your genius and fortune.” 
 “By my fortune! Alack poor souls!” 
 “And is it not a piece of good fortune to be raised so high that there is none above you?” 
 “My fortune! The Gods know—if they know anything—that I would gladly exchange my lot with
      that of a poor woman in a cottage who spins and sings, or of a girl among the mountains who
      keeps goats and is defended by a boisterous dog. Mother, listen to me. I have brought
      misfortune on Lucius Lamia, I have caused the death of that harmless actor Paris, I have
      been the occasion of Cornelia being—buried alive—watching the expiring of the one
      lamp. Ye Gods! Ye Gods! I shall go mad—and of Celer also.—He——” 
 She held her face, rocked herself on the seat and sobbed as if her heart would break. 
 “Yes,” said the old lady, roused to anger at her daughter’s lack of appreciation of the
      splendor of her position. “Yes, child, and mischief you will work on every one, if you
      continue in the same course. Do men say that the Augustus is morose? Who made him so?—you by
      your behavior. Do they say that he is severe in his judgments? Who has hardened him and made
      him cruel?—You—who have dried up all the springs of tenderness in his breast. He was not so at
      first. If he be what men think—it is your work. You with your stinging words goaded him to
      madness and as he cannot or will not beat you, as you deserve, he deals the blows on some one
      else. Of course he cuts away such as you regard and love—because they obtain that to which he
      has a right, but which you deny him.” 
 “He—he—a right!” 
 Domitia started up, anger, resentment, hatred flared in her eyes, stiffened the muscles of
      her whole face, made her hair bristle above her brow. 
 “He a right, mother! he who tore me away from my dear Lamia, to whom I had given my whole
      heart, to whom I had been united by your sanction and our union blessed by the Gods! He who
      violated hospitality, the most sacred rights that belong to a house, who repaid your kindness
      in saving his life—when he was hunted like a wolf, by breaking and destroying, by trampling
      under his accursed heel, the brittle, innocent heart of the daughter of her who had protected
      him! No, mother, I owed him no love. I have never given him any, because he never
      had a right to any. Mother—this must have an end.” 
 She sank into silence that continued for some while. 
 Duilia did not speak. She did not desire another such explosion, lest the slaves should
      hear and betray what had been said. Presently, however, she whispered coaxingly:—
     
 “My dear Domitia, you are overwrought. You have eaten something that has affected your
      temper. I find gherkins always disagree with me. There, go and take a little ginger in white
      wine, and sleep it off.” 
 Domitia rose, stiffly, as though all her joints were wooden. 
 “Yes, mother, I will go. But there is one thing I desire of thee. I have long coveted it,
      as a remembrancer of my father—may I take it?” 
 “Anything—anything you like.” 
 Domitia went to the wall and took down the sword of Corbulo, there suspended. 
 “It is this, mother. I need it.” 
 Then she departed. 
 “That sword—ah!” said Duilia. “It has been a little overdone. I have caught my guests
      exchanging winks when I alluded to it, and dropped a tear. O by all means she shall have it.
      It has ceased to be of use to me.” 
 Elymas the sorcerer stood bowing before Domitia, his hands crossed upon his breast. 
 She looked scrutinizingly into his dark face, but could read nothing there. He remained
      immovable and silent before her, awaiting the announcement of her will. 
 “I have sent for thee,” she said. “How long, I would know, before the sixth veil falls?” 
 “Lady and Augusta,” answered the Magian, “remember that when thou lookest out upon the
      Sabine Mountains, on one day all is so distinct that thou wouldst suppose a walk of an hour
      would bring thee to them. On the morrow, the range is so faint and so remote, that thou
      wouldst consider it must require days of travel to attain their roots. It is so with the
      Future. We look into its distance and behold forms—but whether near or far we know not. This
      only do we say with confidence, that we are aware of their succession, but not of their
      nearness or remoteness.” 
 “What! and the stars, will they not help thee?” 
 “There is at this time an ominous conjuncture of planets.” 
 “I pray thee, spare me the details, and tell me that which they portend.” 
 “Is it thine own future, Augusta, thou desirest to look into?” 
 “Elymas, my story has been unfolded—to what an
      extent it has been managed by such as thyself, that I cannot judge. But of a
      certainty it was thou who didst contrive that I was carried away from my husband’s house. Then
      what followed, the Gods know how far thou wast in it, but I have heard it said that the God
      Titus would not have had his mortal thread cut short but that, when in fever, thou didst
      persuade him to a bath in snow water. It is very easy to predict what will be, when with our
      hands we mould the future. And now—I care not whether thou makest or predictest what is to
      be—but an end there must be, and that a speedy one—for thine own safety hangs thereon.” 
 “How so, lady?” 
 “The Augustus has been greatly alarmed of late at sinister omens and prophesies; and he
      attributes them to thee. Perhaps,” with a scornful intonation, “he also is aware that
      fulfilment is assured before a prophesy is given out.” 
 The Magus remained motionless, but his face became pale. 
 “I know, because at supper with his intimates, Messala and Regulus and Carus, he swore by
      the Gods he would have you cast to savage dogs, and he would make an example of such as filled
       men’s minds with expectation of evil.” 
 “Lady——” 
 But Domitia interrupted him. “Thou thinkest that I say this to alarm thee and bend thee to
      my will. If the Augustus has his spies that watch and repeat to him whatsoever I do,
      whomsoever I see, almost every word I say—shall not I also have a watch put upon him? Even
      now, Magus, that I have sent for thee, and that thou art closely consulted by me this has
      been carried to his ears, and as he knows how I esteem him, he will think this
      interview bodes him no good.” 
 “When, Lady Augusta, was this said?” 
 “The Emperor is this day returned from Albanum, and the threat was made but yesterday. Who
      can say but that the order has already been given for thy arrest, and for the gathering
      together of the dogs that are to rend thee.” 
 The man became alarmed and moved uneasily. 
 “Magus,” said Domitia, “I cannot save thee, thine own wits must do that. Find it written in
      the stars that thy life is so bound up with that of the Cæsar, that the death of one is the
      extinction of the other; or that thou holdest so potent a charm that if thou wilt thou canst
      employ it for his destruction. It is not for me to point out how thou mayest twist out of his
      grasp—thou art a very eel for slipperiness, and a serpent for contrivance. What I desire to
      know is—How much longer is this tyranny to last, and how long am I to suffer?” 
 Then the magician looked round the room, to make sure that he was unobserved; he raised the
      curtain at the door to see that none listened outside, and satisfied that he was neither
      observed nor overheard, he pointed to a clepsydra. 
 This was an ingenious, but to our minds a clumsy, contrivance for measuring time. It
      consisted of a silver ball, with a covered opening at the top, through which the interior
      could be replenished. About the base of the globe were minute perforations through which the
      liquid that was placed in the vessel slowly oozed, and oozing ran together into a drop at the
      bottom which fell at intervals into the bucket of a tiny wheel. 
 When the bucket was full, the wheel revolved and
      decanted the liquid whilst presenting another bucket to the distilling drops. 
 At each movement of the wheel a connection with it gave motion to the hand of a statuette
      of Saturn, who with his scythe indicated a number on an arc of metal. The numbers ranged from
      one to twelve, and the contrivance answered for half the twenty-four hours. 
 “Lady,” said the Magus, “before Saturn has pointed to the twelfth hour——” 
 Steps were heard, approaching the room, along the mosaic-laid passage, and next moment, the
      curtain was snatched aside, and Domitian, his face blazing with anger, entered the apartment
      of his wife. 
 “So?” said he, “you are in league with astrologers and magicians against me! But, by the
      Gods! I can protect myself.” 
 He clapped his hands, and some of the guard appeared in the doorway. 
 “Remove him,” said the Emperor. “I have given orders concerning him already. Hey! Magus!
      knowest thou what will be thy doom, thou who pretendest to read the fate of men in the
       stars?” 
 “Augustus,” answered the necromancer, “I have read that I should be rent by wild dogs.” 
 “Sayest thou so? Then by Jupiter! I will make thy forecast come to naught. Go, Eulogius!—it
      is my command that he be at once, mark you, this very night, burned alive. We will see whether
      his prophecies come true. Here is my order.” 
 Domitian plucked a packet of tablets from his bosom, bound together with a string, drew
      forth one, and wrote hastily on it, then pressed his seal on the wax that covered the slab and
      handed it to the officer. 
 Then the guard surrounded the astrologer, and led him away. 
 Domitian waved his hand. 
 “Every one out of earshot,” ordered he, and he walked to the window and looked forth. 
 It was already night; to the south the sky was quivering with lightning, summer flashes,
      without thunder. 
 “A storm, a storm is coming on,” said the Emperor; “there’ll be storms everywhere, and
      lightning falling on all sides—portents they say. So be it! as the sword of heaven smites, so
      does mine. But it falls not on me, but on my enemies. Domitia,” said he, leaving the window,
      “there has been a conspiracy entered into against my life, and the fools thought to set up
      Clemens—he, that weakling, that coward; but I have sent him to his death, and those who were
      associated with him, the sentence is gone forth against them also.” 
 “I marvel only that any in Rome are suffered to live.” 
 “Minerva gives me wisdom—to defend myself.” 
 “Any wild beast can employ teeth and claws.” 
 “Domitia,” he came close to her, “I am the most lonely of men. I have no friends; my
      kinsmen either have been, or hate me; my friends are the most despicable of flatterers, who
      would betray their own parents to save their own throats; I use them, but I scorn them. You
      know not what it is to be alone!” 
 “I! I have been alone ever since you tore me from Lamia.” 
 “Lamia!” he ground his teeth; “still Lamia! But by the Gods! not for long. And you—you my
      wife whom I have loved, for whom I would have done anything—you are against me; you take
      counsel with a
      Chaldæan how long I have to live; the Senate, the nobles hate me, and by Jupiter,
      they have good cause, for I cut them with a scythe like ripe wheat. That was a good lesson of
      Tarquin to his son Sextus to nip off the heads of the tallest poppies. And the people—you have
      been currying favor with them—against me; the soldiers alone love me, because I have doubled
      their pay; let another offer to treble it and, to a man, they will desert me. By the
      Immortals! it is terrible to be alone—and to be plotted against, even by one’s wife.” 
 He walked the room, flourishing his tablets, then halted in front of the clepsydra. 
 “What said that star-gazer about the twelfth hour?” he asked. “Walls have ears, nothing is
      said that does not reach me. So, old Saturn, with thy scythe, dost thou threaten? Then I defy
      thee—ha! I saw the storm was coming up over Rome.” 
 A long-drawn growl of thunder muttered through the passages of the palace. 
 “I saw no flash,” said the prince, “yet lightning falls somewhere, maybe to kindle the pyre
      on which that sorcerer will burn; I care not. Fire of heaven fall and strike where and whom
      thou wilt!” 
 He went again to the window and looked forth. The air was still and close. The sky was
      enveloped in vapor and not a star could be seen. A continuous quiver of electric light ran
      along the horizon. Then the heavens seemed to be rent asunder and a blaze of lightning shot
      forth, blinding to the eyes. 
 Domitian turned away, and laid the tablets on the marble sideboard as he pressed his hands
      to his eyeballs. 
 “By the Gods!” he exclaimed a moment later, “here comes the rain; it descends in cataracts;
      it falls with a roar.” 
 He paced the room, halted, stood in front of the clepsydra and looked at the dropping
      water. The water had been reddened, and it seemed like blood sweated out of the silver globe.
      At that moment the wheel revolved, and sent a crimson gush into the receiver. With a jerk
      Saturn raised his scythe and indicated the hour ten. 
 The Emperor turned away, and came in front of Domitia. 
 “None have ever loved me,” he said bitterly, “how then can it be expected that I shall love
      any? my father disliked me, my brother distrusted me—and you—my wife, have ever hated me. I
      need not ask the cause of that. It is Lamia, always Lamia. Because he has never married you
      think he still harbors love for you; and you—you hate me because of him. It is hard to be a
      prince, and to be alone. If I hear a play—I think I catch allusions to me; if it be a
      comedy—there is a jest aimed at me; if a tragedy, it expresses what men wish may befall me. If
      I read a historian, he declaims on the glories of a commonwealth before these men, these
      Cæsars became tyrants, and as for your philosophers—away with them, they are wind-bags, but
      the wind is poisonous, it is malarious to me. When I am at the circus, because I back
      green—you, the entire hoop of spectators cheer, bet on the blue—to show me that they hate me.
      At the Amphitheatre, if I favor the big shields, then every one else is for the small targets.
      A prince is ever the most solitary of men. If you had protested that you loved me, had
      fondled me, I would have held you in suspicion, mistrusted your every word and
      look and gesture. Perhaps it is because that you have never given me good word, gentle look,
      and gesture of respect that I feel you are true—cruelly true, and I have loved you as the only
      true person I know. Now answer me—you asked after my death?” 
 “Yes,” answered Domitia. 
 “I knew it.” 
 “And,” said she, in cold, hard tones, looking straight into his agitated, twitching
      countenance, “I bear to you a message.” 
 “From whom?” 
 “From Cornelia, the Great Mother.” 
 “Well, and what——” he stopped, some one approached the door. “What would you have?” 
 The mime Latinus appeared. 
 “Well—speak.” 
 “Sire, the rain extinguished the pyre, before that the astrologer was much burnt; then the
      dogs fell on him, as he was unbound, and they tore him and he is dead.” 
 “Ye Gods!” gasped Domitian, putting up his hand. “His word has come true after all.” 
 Domitia signed to the actor to withdraw. 
 “You have not heard the message of Cornelia.” 
 He did not speak. 
 “She has summoned you, the Augustus, the Chief Pontiff, the unjust Judge, to answer before
      the All-righteous Supreme Justice, above—before the scythe points to Twelve.” 
 Domitian answered not a word, he threw his mantle about his face and left the room. 
 He had left his tablets on the table. 
 For some moments Domitia remained without stirring. But then, roused by a glare of
      lightning, succeeded by a crash so loud as to shake the palace, she saw in the white blaze the
      tablets of the Emperor lying on the table. 
 At once, aware of the importance of what she had secured, she seized them, and went to the
      lamp to open them. 
 They consisted of thin citron-wood boards, framed and hinged on one side, the surfaces
      within covered with a film of wax, on which notes were inscribed with a
       stile or iron pen. There were stray leaves that served for correspondence,
      orders and so forth, but what Domitia now held was a diptych, that is to say, two leaves
      hinged, like a book-cover, which had included loose sheets and were bound together by strings. 
 She at once opened the diptych, and saw on the first page:— 
 “To be executed immediately:—   In the Tullianum, by strangulation,     Lucius Ælius Lamia
      Plautius Ælianus. To be torn by dogs:—   The Chaldæan Elymas, otherwise called Ascletarion.” 
 On the second leaf: 
 “To be executed on the morrow:— By decapitation:   Petronius Secundus, Præfect of the
      Prætorium.   Norbanus, likewise Præfect of the Prætorium. By strangling, in the Tullianum:
        Parthenius and Sigerius, Chamberlains of the Palace. To be bled to death:   Stephanus:
      steward to my niece Domitilla.   Entellus: Secretary a
       libellis.” 
 The words applying to Lamia acted on her as a blow against her heart. She staggered to a
      stool, sank on it and struggled for breath. 
 But the urgency of the danger allowed no delay—she rallied her strength immediately, flew
      from the room and summoned Eboracus. 
 To him, breathless, she said: “Fly—summon me at once Stephanus the steward, Petronius and
      Norbanus, præfects, and the chamberlains Parthenius and Sigerius. Bid them come to me at
      once—not make a moment’s delay.” 
 She sank again on the stool and put her hands to her temples and pressed them. 
 The lightning continued to flare and the thunder to roll. There ensued a turmoil, and a
      sound of voices crying; then a rush of feet. Euphrosyne entered with startled mien—“My
      mistress! The bolt of heaven has fallen on the Palatine, and the chamber of the
      Augustus has been struck. The Temple of the Flavians is on fire, and is burning
      in despite of the rain.” 
 The chamberlain, Parthenius, entered. 
 “Augusta!” said he, “the lightning has struck that part of the palace occupied by Cæsar. He
      must have his apartment for the night on this side.” 
 “That is well,” answered Domitia. “Parthenius, have you received my message from Eboracus?” 
 “No, lady.” 
 “Then read this,” she extended to him the wax tablets. 
 The chamberlain turned ash gray and trembled. 
 “Parthenius,” said Domitia, “it is no vain augury that lightning has struck the Temple of
      the Flavians, and driven Cæsar from his apartments. Let his place of rest be to-night in the
      room adjoining this—and—if he wakes—” she looked at the clepsydra, as at that moment with a
      click the wheel turned and Saturn moved his scythe—“there is but an hour in which the fate of
      more than yourself, of Lamia—of Entellus must be decided. Take the tablets.” 
 Scarce had she spoken, before quick steps were heard, and in a moment Domitian entered. 
 Parthenius hastily concealed the tablets by throwing a fold of his garment over the hand
      that held them. “Sire,” said he, “I have come to announce that thy chamber must be on this
      side.” 
 “Go thy way,” said Domitian roughly, “see to it that I have a bed brought at once. Hast
      heard, Domitia, the fire has fallen!” 
 “Sire,” said Parthenius, “I haste to obey and pray the Gods that in spite of thunder and
      lightning you may sleep sound and not wake.” 
 The Emperor walked to the clepsydra, and laughed scornfully. “The bolt of Jove has missed
      me,” said he. “The red-handed One made a mistake. I am wont to be in bed at this hour—by good
      luck, this night I was not. He has levelled his bolt at my pillow and burnt that—I am escaped
      scot-free. Now I have no further fear.” 
 “The temple of your divine family is in flames.” 
 “What care I? I will rebuild it—the majesty, the divinity of the Flavians resides not in
      stones and marble—it is incorporate in Me. I may have been in danger for a moment. Now I snap
      my fingers in the face of that blunderer Jove, who burnt a hole in my pillow instead of
      transfixing my head. And yon old Chronos—” he made a sign of contempt towards scythed Time, “I
      defy thee and thy bucket of blood. Twelve o’clock! In spite of Jove’s bolt, and the summons of
      Cornelia—I shall be asleep by that hour.” 
 “I pray the Gods it may be so.” 
 Then Domitian went out precipitately. His defiant attitude, his daring talk did not serve
      to disguise the alarm which he felt. Suddenly, after having left the room he turned, came back
      and said, “Domitia! What sword is that? What need has a woman with a sword?” 
 He pointed to that of Corbulo, suspended against the wall. 
 He went to it and took it down. 
 “Leave it,” said she harshly. “It is that on which my father fell. It is stained likewise
      with the blood of Nero.” 
 He held it by the scabbard. She caught the handle and, as he turned, drew forth the blade. 
 At the same moment he heard steps in the passage
      approaching the door, and without noticing that he held but the sheath, or else
      purposing to demand the weapon itself later, when the interruption was over, he walked towards
      the entrance uttering an expression of impatience, holding the empty scabbard in his right
      hand. 
 In the doorway stood Stephanus, a freedman, the steward of Flavia Domitilla, wife, or
      rather widow of Clemens, whom Domitian had recently put to death. Domitilla had been exiled,
      and the Emperor had appropriated to his own use the estates of his kinsman. 
 “Why camest thou hither?” asked the prince roughly. “I shall have enough to say to thee on
      the morrow because of thy embezzlements.” 
 “Augustus! I am innocent.” 
 “A thief, a vile purloiner, a blood-sucking leech, that has fattened as do all thy kind on
      thy masters. Go thy way—I want thee not here.” 
 And striding towards him, with Corbulo’s scabbard he struck the freedman across the face. 
 Stephanus uttered a cry of rage and pain, and instantly smote at the Emperor with a dagger
      he had held concealed in his sleeve. 
 “What, hound! You dare! You shall be flayed alive! Ho! to my aid!” 
 Stephanus threw himself on the Emperor. 
 Then Domitia stepped between the struggling men and the doorway, and with one hand drew
      together the curtains so as to muffle the cries. 
 “To my aid! to my aid!” called Domitian, as the powerful steward grappled him, and struck
      his dagger into the thigh of the prince. 
 “To my aid! Ho, a sword!” shouted the Emperor, and he grasped the weapon of the steward but
      so that, holding the blade with his hand, the weapon cut it across and the blood
      streamed forth. 
 He now made an effort to reach the doorway; and the steward, holding him, strove to wrench
      away the dagger and inflict a mortal wound. But Domitian, aware of his object, with his
      bleeding hand retained his grasp of the blade. 
 All at once, the Emperor let go his hold, and seizing the steward by the head drove his
      thumbs into his eyes. 
 Stephanus instantly dropped the dagger in his attempt to save himself from being blinded. 
 The two men twisted and writhed in grapple with each other. The freedman was a powerful
      man—it was for this reason he had been sent to despatch the prince. But Domitian was battling
      for his life. Though his legs were thin and out of proportion to his body, he was a strong
      man—he had ever maintained his vigor by exercise of the muscles and had never weakened himself
      by excess in eating and drinking. 
 By a happy turn he flung Stephanus, but clasped by him fell with him on the floor. 
 And now the two men rolled and tossed in a tangled mass together. Their snorts and gasps
      and the bestial growl of rage filled the room. 
 “Quick! Domitia—the sword! At once—the sword—the sword!” said the Emperor. He spoke in
      gulps and gasps. 
 He had Stephanus under him; his knee was on his chest and his hand, the gashed left hand
      flowing with blood, contracted the prostrate man’s throat. 
 “Domitia! the sword!” 
 But she stood, stern, cold, without stirring a step,
      and she folded the sword of her father to her breast, with her arms crossed over
      it. 
 “Because of Paris—No!” 
 “The sword! be speedy. I will finish him!” 
 “Because of Cornelia—No!” 
 “Domitia—help!” 
 “Because of Lucius Lamia—No!” 
 She went to the curtains, drew them apart, and called down the passage to Norbanus. 
 The two Prætorian præfects were there with the chamberlains—but they were ill able to
      restrain the guard who suspected that their prince and Emperor was in danger and scented
      treachery. 
 Instantly a rush was made. Some of the soldiers, with the præfect Norbanus, came on
      running, whilst the other, Petronius Secundus, endeavored by his authority to restrain the
      rest. 
 But from the other end of the passage came gladiators running, hastily brought together by
      Parthenius. 
 For a moment there was a jam in the doorway, a burly gladiator and a soldier of the guard
      were wedged together, each endeavoring to hold the other back and force himself in. 
 Meanwhile Petronius continued to exhort his soldiers to stand back, and Parthenius to
      promise rewards to the gladiators who pressed on. The tumult became terrible. Men came to
      blows without, there was a running together of slaves and freedmen—of frightened women and
      pages from all sides. Some had leaped from their beds, roused from sleep, and were not
      clothed. Some bore lamps—but again certain others attempted to extinguish the lights. Some
      cried “Treason!” Others “Away with the monster!”
      Some called out “Nerva is the Emperor!” others “Domitian is the
      Augustus!” 
 Then the gladiator at the door, by dint of elbowing, forced his way within, but he was
      unarmed. 
 Next moment the Prætorian guardsman held back by the gladiator entered and struck at
      Stephanus, dealing a frightful blow. 
 Relieved by this assistance, Domitian staggered to his feet and glared about him. He was
      too much out of breath to speak, and in at the door came others pressing, some crying one
      thing, some another. 
 Then Domitia unfolded her arms, and taking the sword of Corbulo in her right hand, extended
      it to the gladiator and said—“Make an end.” 
 The man snatched at the haft; and with a blow drove the blade into the breast of the
      Emperor. 
 Still the prince remained standing, and stretched forth his hands gropingly for a weapon. 
 Parmenas leaped at him, and with a knife struck him in the throat. 
 Then he reeled; in another moment he was surrounded, blows from all sides were rained on
      him. Again the sword of Corbulo was lifted and again smote, and he fell as a heap on the body
      of Stephanus. 
 For a moment there was stillness. 
 Then in that hush sounded a click and a gush. The bucket of the clepsydra had discharged,
      and with a jerk Saturn raised his scythe and pointed to the hour of midnight. 
 “He has answered his summons before the seat of Divine Justice!” said Domitia. 
 She stooped and plucked the signet ring from the finger of the murdered prince. 
 No sooner had Domitia got the signet from the finger of the dead Emperor, than she hastened
      from the room, trembling, almost blind as to her course, but armed with more than her natural
      strength to force her way through those who filled the passage. 
 Parmenas was now there, and he cleared a way for her, and in a loud voice forbade any of
      the slaves to leave the palace; Petronius at the same time gave orders to the soldiers of the
      guard to remain where they were, keeping watch that none left to spread the tidings, until
      Cocceius Nerva had been communicated with, and the Senate had been summoned. 
 Domitia, however, made her way from among the excited and alarmed throng, and finding some
      of her own slaves, bade them bring Eboracus to her. 
 “I am here, lady,” answered the Briton. 
 “Then quick—with me. Not a moment is to be lost. Light a torch and lead the way.” 
 “Whither, mistress?” 
 “To the Tullianum.” 
 He stared at her in amazement. 
 “Quick—a life, a precious life is at stake. Not a minute must we delay or it will be too
      late.” 
 “I am ready, lady.” 
 He snatched a torch from an attendant, and advanced towards a postern gate that
      communicated with a flight of steps leading to the Forum. It was employed almost
      wholly by the servants and was used for communication between the kitchen and the
      markets. 
 “Shall we take any one else with us?” asked Eboracus. He answered himself—“Yes—here is
      Euphrosyne. She shall attend, and a boy shall carry the link. At night—and on such a night, I
      must have both arms at my disposal.” 
 Domitia said nothing. She was eager to be on her way, was impatient of the smallest delay.
      Euphrosyne came up, and obeyed a sign from the Briton. He caught a scullion who was rubbing
      his sleepy eyes, and wondering what had caused the commotion, and had roused him from his bed.
      Eboracus thrust the torch into his hand and opened the door for the Empress. 
 Domitia stepped out to the head of the stairs. The rain had ceased, but the steps were
      running with water. The eaves dripped. The shrubs were laden with rain, they stooped their
      boughs and shed a load of moisture on the soil, then raised their leaves again, once more to
      accumulate the wet, and again to stoop and shower it down. Runnels conveying water from the
      roof were flowing as streams, noisily: the ground covered with pools, reflected the torch; as
      also every gleam from the retiring storm. Still in the distance thunder muttered, but it was a
      grumble of discontent at having failed to achieve all it had been sent to execute. 
 On such a night few would be abroad, except the patrols of the Vigiles
      and them there would be no difficulty in passing as the watchword was known to Eboracus, the
      word which allowed those only who could say it to traverse the streets at night in the
      respectable portions of the city. But there were no lamps, not even the feeble glimmer of a
      lantern slung in the midst of the street. Notwithstanding all the civili
      zation of ancient Rome the art of lighting the thoroughfares at night was
      unknown. Such as were constrained to walk abroad after dark were attended by slaves bearing
      torches. 
 The streets of Rome had for long been of bad repute for the brawls and murders committed in
      them at night. Tipsy youths and rufflers had assaulted honest men, and should a woman be out
      after dark, she was certain of insult. Nero himself had distinguished himself in such vulgar
      performances. But under the Flavian princes much had been done to establish order and to
      ensure protection to life and purse of such as were out after dark, so that now, except in the
      slums, a citizen could visit his friends, a doctor his patients, by night, without fear of
      molestation. 
 And of all portions of Rome, the Forum with its splendid monuments, its rich temples,
      especially that of Saturn, that contained the city treasures, was most patrolled and therefore
      the safest. Eboracus had little expectation that his mistress would meet with rudeness or
      encounter danger, the rain must have swept the street of all idlers. 
 The long flight of steps was descended with caution, as they were slippery with rain,
      indeed with more caution than Domitia approved, so impatient was she to reach the object of
      her journey. The distance was not great. She had but to traverse the upper end of the Forum. 
 That at which she aimed was the prison of Rome. It lay at the foot of the Capitoline Hill,
      and consisted of an ancient well or subterranean chamber in which flowed a small spring. Above
      this was the prison, consisting of a series of cells that rose in stages to a considerable
      height, against the rock, the chambers being in part scooped out of the travestine. From the
      top
      of the hill ran a set of steps called the Gemonian stair, and it was customary
      for State prisoners who had been condemned to death, after execution to be cast from the upper
      chamber of the Tullianum down the stairs; whence with hooks the corpses were dragged across
      the Forum and then flung into the Tiber. 
 To the house of the jailer, Domitia with her attendants made her way. She had been stopped
      once in crossing the Forum, but the watch recognized her, and saluted with respect, though
      with an expression of astonishment on his countenance at seeing Cæsar’s wife abroad at such a
      time of the night, in such weather and with such scant attendance. 
 On reaching the jailer’s door, Eboracus knocked. No answer was given. He knocked again and
      louder, and continued knocking, till at length a gruff voice from within called to know who
      was without, and what was wanted. 
 “Open—in the name of the Augustus,” said the British slave; and at once the keeper of the
      prison let down the bars and withdrew the bolts and chains, then carrying a lamp, peered out
      at those who demanded admittance. 
 Then Domitia stood forward. 
 “You have a prisoner here—Lucius Ælius Lamia?” 
 “Yes.” 
 “You must lead me to him.” 
The jailer appeared disconcerted, he held his lamp aloft and eyed the woman who
      spake. He did not know her, his light was feeble, and as it happened, he had seen little of
      the Empress. 
 “You do not know me,” said Domitia. “Know you this ring?” 
 The prison-keeper held the flame of his lamp to the
      signet, and made the usual sign of respect and recognition. 
 “You are required to lead me within,” said Domitia. 
 The jailer at once stood aside, and suffered the Empress and her attendants to enter. Then
      he barred and bolted the door again. 
 “And now,” said Domitia, impatient at the leisurely proceeding of the man, “lead me to
      him.” 
 Without another word he went forward, holding his lamp down that those who followed might
      see the steps and not stumble at them. 
 “This way,” said he, “and bow your heads, the entrance is low; but most of them that pass
      this way have to hold their heads still lower when they are taken out. Look at these
      stones—great blocks built by the Kings—by Servius Tullus, they say. By Hercules! this is not a
      tavern where men tarry long, nor do they relish our fare. One thing I must say in our favor,
      we make no charge for our hospitality.” Thus the jailer muttered as he went along. 
 “Look there—on your right—there is the cell where Simon Bar Gioras, the Jew, was
      strangled—he who was the last to maintain the struggle against the God Titus, in defence of
      Jerusalem; and see—” he threw open a door. “Here is the Bath of Mamertius in which Jugurtha
      was starved, all in blackness of darkness and soaking in ice-cold water. What! Impatient—do
      you not care to see the sights and hear my gossip? Well, well—but I have pretty things to
      show. I have a shankbone of Appius Claudius, who committed suicide in yon cell, and a garment
      of Sejanus, and the very bowstring wherewith—I am going on as fast as may be. See! we have had
      Christians here also. There was another Jew, Simon Petrus by name, he was in this
      cell, and I have the chain whereby he was bound, and I sell the links to the
      followers of the Nazarene,” he began to cackle. “By Hercules! the chain is long enough. They
      come for more links than there would be, were the chain to reach across the Tiber. But any bit
      of old iron will serve, and they are not particular—take any scrap and pay in silver. I am
      going as fast as may be. I am not young. Fast enough I warrant. He is in no hurry—not Lamia.
      He can wait. All the same to him whether we reach him now or an hour hence.” 
 Then Domitia, whose brow was beaded with cold sweat, like the stones of the vault that ran
      with moisture, laid hold of the prison-keeper’s arm and said:—“Tell me—is he—” she could not
      say the word, her heart beat so furiously, and everything swam before her eyes. 
 “Aye, aye, you shall see for yourself. Come from the Augustus to satisfy him that we do our
      work properly, I trow. I have not much strength in these old-hands, but my two sons are
      lusty—and say the word—they will bend your back and snap the spine, smite and shear off your
      head like a pumpkin under a scythe, twist, and the life is throttled out of you. Here—here we
      are. Go in and see for yourself that we are good workmen.” 
 He threw open a door and raised his lamp. 
 A low vaulted chamber was faintly illumined by the flame, the torch held by Eboracus was
      behind Domitia and the jailer; he had taken it from the link boy at the prison door. He and
      Euphrosyne attended their mistress, the boy was left without. 
 The old prison-keeper stood on one side. 
 “The order came yesterday,” said he, “and we are not slack in the execution.” 
 Domitia saw the figure of a man lying on the stone floor. She started forward— 
 “He sleeps!” 
 “I warrant you—right soundly.” 
 She uttered a smothered cry. 
 “Put down the lamp!” 
 She turned and faced the jailer. “Leave me alone with him. I will wake him. I know he but
      sleeps.” 
 The man hesitated. 
 Then Eboracus pressed forward and laid hold of the jailer and whispered—“Go without, it is
      the Augusta!” 
 The keeper of the prison started, raised his hand to his lips, bowed, set the lamp on the
      moist floor and drew back. 
 “Without! Without all!” ordered Domitia. 
 Then Eboracus pulled the jailer out of the cell. Euphrosyne stood doubtful whether to
      remain with her mistress or obey—but an impatient sign from the Empress drove her forth, and
      the British slave closed the door. 
 “He is dead,” said the jailer. “Did the Augustus desire to withdraw the order? His signet
      has arrived too late. The prisoner has been throttled by my sons.” 
 The old man and the two slaves remained for some quarter of an hour in the passage almost
      smothered by the smoke emitted by the torch. 
 From within they heard a voice—at intervals, now raised in weeping, then uttering low
      soothing tones, then raised in a cry as the conclamatio of hired wailers
      for the dead, calling on Lamia by name to return, to return, to leave the Shadowland and come
      back into light. 
 And then—a laugh. 
 A laugh so weird, so horrible, so unexpected, that with a thrust, without scruple, Eboracus
      threw open the door. 
 On the stone pavement sat Domitia, her hair dishevelled, and on her lap the head of the
      dead man. She was wiping his brow with her veil, stooping, kissing his lips, weeping, then
      laughing again—then pointing to purple letters, crossed L’s woven into his tunic. 
 Eboracus saw it all—her reason was gone. 
 In the old home of Gabii, under the tender care of Euphrosyne and in the soothing company
      of Glyceria, little by little, stage by stage, Domitia recovered. 
 There was a horrible past to which no reference might be made. The true British slave,
      Eboracus, was ever at hand to help—when needed. Never a day, never half a day, but his honest
      face appeared at the door to inquire after his dear lady, and as her senses came flickering
      back, it was he to whom she clung to take her in his arms into the trellised walk, or when
      stronger to lead her where she could pick violets for Glyceria, and to pile about the feet of
      the little statue of the Good Shepherd. He took her a row on the lake and let her fish—he
      found nests of young birds and brought them to her; and all at once disclosed great powers of
      story-telling; he told marvellous British tales as to a little child, of the ploughing of Hu
      Cadarn, of Ceridwen and her cauldron. And he would sing—he fashioned himself a harp, of
      British shape, and sang as he accompanied himself, but his ballads were all in the Celtic
      tongue that Domitia could not understand—
      nevertheless it soothed and pleased her to listen to his music. 
 Longa Duilia did not visit her often. She made formal duty calls at long intervals, and as
      Domitia became better, these visits grew proportionately fewer. 
 Duilia, as she herself said, was not created to be a nurse. She knew that some were fitted
      by nature to attend to the sick, and all that sort of thing—but it was not her gift. Society
      was her sphere in which she floated and which she adorned, but she was distraught and drooping
      in a sick-room. She wished she had the faculty—and all that sort of thing—but all women were
      not cast in the same mould, run out of the same metal—and, my dear, parenthetically—some are
      of lead, others of Corinthian brass—and which are which it is not for me to say—she thanked
      the Gods it was so. 
 Nor did the visits and efforts to amuse, of Duilia, avail anything towards Domitia’s cure.
      On the contrary, she was always worse after her mother had been with her. The old lady ripped
      up ill-healed sores, harped on old associations, could not check her tongue from scolding. 
 “My poor dear child—I never made a greater blunder in my life—I, too, who have the pedigree
      at my finger’s ends—as to fancy that there was any connection with those Flavians. My dear!
      yellow hair is quite out of fashion now, quite out. Look at mine, a raven’s wing is not
      darker. It was through Vespasia Polla—I thought we were related—stupid that I was—it was the
      Vipsanians we were allied to, not those low and beggarly Vespasians. As the Gods love me, I
      believe Polla’s father was an army contractor. But I have made it all right. I have smudged
      out the line I had
      added to the family tree, and as for the wax heads of those Flavians, I have had
      them melted up. Will you believe it—I had the mask of Domitian run into a pot and that stupid
      Lucilla did not put a cover on it, and the rats have eaten it—eaten all the wax. I hope it has
      clogged their stomachs and given them indigestion. They doubtless thought it was dripping. But
      I really have made a most surprising discovery. I find there was an alliance with the
      Cocceii—most respectable family, very ancient, admirable men all—and so there is a sort of
      cousinship with the present admirable prince. His brother Aulus—rather old perhaps—but an
      estimable man—is—well—may be—in a word, I intend to give a little supper—a dainty affair—all
      in the best style—so sorry you can’t be there, my dear Domitia—but of course absolutely
      impossible. Your state of health and all that sort of thing. Don’t be surprised if you
      hear—but there, there—he is rather old though, for one who is only just turning off the very
      bloom of life and beauty.” 
 After such a visit and such talk the mind of Domitia was troubled for several days. She
      became timid, alarmed at the least noise, and distraught. But then the poor crippled woman
      succeeded in comforting and laying her troubles, and the painful expression faded from her
      face. It became placid, but always with a sadness that was inseparable from the eyes, and a
      tremulousness of the lips, as though a very little—a rough word or two—would dissolve her into
      tears. 
 With the spring, the growing light, the increasing warmth, the bursting life in plant and
      insect, she began to amend more steadily, and relapses became fewer. 
 One sweet spring day, when Glyceria had been car
      ried forth into the garden, and Domitia sat on the turf near her with purple
      anemones in her lap, that she was binding into a garland, the paralyzed woman was startled by
      hearing Domitia suddenly speak of the past. 
 She spoke, and continued weaving the flowers, “My Glyceria, I intend this for the little
      temple of my father. It is all I can do for him—to give flowers where his ashes lie—but it
      does not content me. There were two whom I loved and looked up to as the best of men, and both
      are gone—gone to dust: my own dearest father, and my lover, my husband, Lamia. I cannot bear
      to think of them as heaps of ashes or as wandering ghosts. When that thought comes over me, I
      seem to be as one drowning, and then darkness is before my eyes. I cannot cry—I smother.” 
 “Why should you think of them as wandering ghosts or as heaps of dust?” 
 “I know that they are dust—I suppose they are shadows. But of anything else, all is
      guess-work, we know nothing—and that is so horrible. I love two only—have loved two only—and
      they are no more than shadows. No, no! I mean not that.” She flung her arms about Glyceria,
      and laid her cheek against that of the sick woman. “No, I do love you, and I love Euphrosyne
      and I love Eboracus. But I mean—I mean in a different manner. One was my father, and the other
      my husband. It is so terribly sad to think they are lost to me like yesterday or last summer.” 
 “They are not lost. You will see them again.” 
 “See my father! See my Lamia!” 
 “Yes—I know it will be so.” 
 “O, Glyceria, do not say such things. You make my heart jump. How can it be? They have
      been.” 
 “They are and will be. Death is swallowed up in Life.” 
 “That is impossible. Death is death and nothing more.” 
 Then Glyceria took the hand of Domitia, and looking into her eyes, said solemnly: “Dost
      thou remember having asked me about the Fish?” 
 “Yes—this amulet,” answered the noble lady, and she detached the cornelian from her throat,
      and held it in the hand not engaged by Glyceria. “Yes—I recollect—there was some mystery, but
      what was it?” 
 “The Fish is a symbol, as I said once before, and it is no amulet.” 
 “Of what is it the symbol?” 
 “Of One who died—who tasted of the bitterness of the parting of soul and body, and who went
      into the region of Shadows and returned—the soul to the body, and rose from the dead, and by
      the virtue of His resurrection gives power to all who believe in Him to rise in like manner.” 
 “And he could tell about what the ghosts do—how they wander?” 
 “I cannot say that. There would be no comfort in that. He rose to give us joy and to rob
      death of its terrors.” 
 “But what has this to do with the Fish?” 
 “You know what the word Fish is in Greek.” 
 “Very well.” 
 “Take each letter of that word, and each letter is the first of words that contain the very
      substance of the Christian belief—Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Saviour.” 
 Domitia looked at the little cornelian fish; she could not understand. 
 “I believe that one could die and wake again. I have fainted and come round. And he might
      say what was in the spirit world into which he had been—but the region of ghosts is very
      dreary, very sad.” 
 “Nay, He can do more. As He rose, He can raise us to new life, and He will do it, for He is
      God. He made us, and He will recall us from death.” 
 “What—my father! Lucius! I shall see them again—not as shadows, but as they were—?” 
 “Not so—not as they were, mortal; but raised to an immortal life.” 
 “I shall kiss my darling father—put my arms around my Lucius from whom I have been parted
      so long, and so cruelly, and who has been so—so true to me.” 
 Then Domitia burst into tears. 
 Glyceria stroked her hand. 
 “There—you see how joyous is our hope. Death is nothing—it is only a good-bye for a bit to
      meet again.” 
 “O, Glyceria! O, if I could see them—O Glyceria! O, you should not have said this if it be
      not true. My heart will break. O, if it might be so! if I could! but once only—for a moment——” 
 “Nay, that would not suffice; forever, never to be separated; no more tears, no more
      death.” 
 “O, Glyceria—not another word—I cannot bear it. My heart is over full. Another time. My
      head, my head! O, if it might—it could be!” 
 Next day Glyceria saw by the red eyes of Domitia that she had slept little and had wept
      much. She did not turn the conversation to the same topic; she wisely waited for the noble
      lady to begin on it herself, and she judged that she would take some time to consider what had
      been spoken about and to digest it. 
 And in fact Domitia made no further allusion to the matter for some days. But after about a
      week, when alone with the paralyzed woman, she said to her abruptly: “You have never been in
      Syria?” 
 “No, dear lady.” 
 “I have—and I have been on the confines of the desert and looked away, as far as the eye
      could reach, and have seen nothing but sand and barren rock. Behind me a rose-garden,
      syringas, myrtle and citron trees, and murmuring streams, before me—no green leaf, only death.
      It is to me, as I stand now and look back on my life as if it were that barren desert; and the
      fearful thing is—I dare not turn and look the other way, for it is into impenetrable night.
      But no, my life is not all desolation, there are just two green spots in it where the date
      palms stand and there are wells—my childhood, when I sat on my father’s knee and cuddled into
      his arms; and once again, when I was recovering from the loss of him and was basking in the
      joy of my love for Lucius Lamia. All the rest—” she made a gesture of despair—“Death.” 
 “Dearest lady! I would like to turn you about and show you that where you think only
      blackness reigns, lies a beautiful garden, a paradise, and One at the gate who beckons and
      says, Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” 
 “Ah! but that may be all fancy and dream work like the promises of the Magi, and the
      mysteries of Isis.” 
 Glyceria got no further than this. Domitia was disposed to talk with her on her hope, and
      on the Christian belief, but always with reserve and some mistrust. 
 There were old prejudices to be overcome, there was the consciousness that the promises so
      largely made
      by the votaries of the many cults from East and South who came to Rome were
      unfulfilled, and this made her unable to place confidence in the new religion held by slaves
      and ignorant people, however alluring it might seem. 
 Among the very few who came to Gabii during her illness and convalescence, was Flavia
      Domitilla, the widow of Flavius Clemens, who had been put to death by Domitian. Domitilla had
      been banished, but returned immediately on the death of the tyrant. She had suffered as had
      Domitia. In her manner and address there was something so gentle and assuring, that the poor
      ex-empress, in the troubled condition of her brain, was drawn to her, and after her visits
      felt better. She knew, or rather supposed, that Domitilla was a Christian. Her husband had
      been one, and had suffered for his faith. 
 It was with real pleasure that she ran to welcome her one morning, when the steward entered
      and announced: “The Lady Flavia Domitilla.” 
 “I have come, dear Domitia, with a petition,” said the widow of Flavius Clemens. “And it is
      one you will wound me if you refuse.” 
 “But who would wound so gentle a breast?” answered Domitia, kissing her visitor. “He must
      be heartless who draws a bow against a dove.” 
 “Hearken first to what I ask. I am bold—but my very feebleness inspires me with audacity.” 
 “What is it, then?” 
 “That you come with me to my villa for a little change of scene, air and society. It will
      do you good.” 
 “And I cannot refuse. It is like your sweet spirit to desire nothing save what is kindly
      intended and does good to others.” 
 “As you have assented so graciously, I will push my advance a little further and say—Return
      with me to-day. Let us travel together. If you will—I have a double litter—and we can chatter
      as two magpies together.” 
 “Magpies bring sorrow.” 
 “Nay, two—mirth—we have cast our sorrows behind us. You said I was a dove, so be it—a pair
      of doves, perhaps wounded, lamed—but we coo into each other’s ear, and lay our aching hearts
      together and so obtain solace.” 
 “I will refuse you nothing,” said Domitia, again kissing her visitor. 
 Accordingly, a couple of hours later the two ladies started, Domitia taking with her some
      attendants, but travelling, as was proposed, in the large litter of Domitilla. 
 This latter lady was, as already mentioned, the widow of Clemens, one of the two sons of
      Flavius Sabinus, præfect of the city, who had held the Capitol against the Prætorians of
      Vitellius and had been murdered but a few hours before Rome was entered by the troops that
      favored his brother Vespasian. On that occasion his sons had escaped, and the elder was
      married to Julia, daughter of Titus, but had been put to death by Domitian. The younger
      brother, Clemens, a quiet, inoffensive man, who took no part in public affairs, had been
      executed as well, shortly before Domitian himself perished. 
 And now Flavia Domitilla lived quietly on her estate not far from the Ardeatine Gate of
      Rome. 
 “How!” said Flavia, suddenly, as she espied the little cornelian suspended on the bosom of
      Domitia, “you have the Fish!” 
 “Yes, Glyceria gave it me—long ago.” 
 “Do you know what it means?” 
 “Glyceria told me—but it is a dream, a beautiful fancy, nothing more. There is no
      evidence.” 
 “Domitia, you have not sought for it.” 
 “My cousin, Rome is full of religions. Some say the truth is in Sabazius, some in Isis,
      some in the stars, some in Mithras—a new importation—and some will go back to the old Gods of
      our Latin ancestors. But one and another all are naught.” 
 “How know you that?” 
 “By the spirit that is within me. It can discern between what is true and false. Not that
      which promises best is the most real.” 
 “You are right, Domitia—that is truest and most real which meets and satisfies the seeking,
      aching heart.” 
 “And where is that?” 
 “Where you have not sought for it.” 
 “If I were sure I would seek. But I am weary of disillusionings and disappointments.” 
 “Well—will you hear?” 
 “I am not sure. I have met with too many disappointments to desire another.” 
 Nothing further was said on this topic till the villa was reached. Domitia showed that she
      did not desire to have it pursued. 
 As Flavia alighted from her litter, a young man
      approached, handed her something and asked for an answer. 
 The widow of Clemens opened a tied diptych and read some words written therein. 
 She seemed disconcerted and doubtful. She looked questioningly at Domitia, and then asked
      leave of the latter to say a word in private to Euphrosyne. Leave was granted and a whispered
      communication passed between them. 
 Again Flavia looked inquiringly at Domitia, and it was with considerable hesitation that
      she signed to the young man to approach, and said:—“Be it so. The Collect shall be here.” 
 That evening before she and her guest parted for the night, Flavia took Domitia by the hand
      and said:—“You are right—the faculty of determination is seated in every breast. Inquire and
      choose.” 
 A few days passed, and then the hostess became uneasy. Evidently she had something that she
      desired to say, but was afraid of broaching the subject. 
 At length, abruptly, she began on it. 
 “Domitia, I show you the utmost confidence. I must tell you something. You know how that
      the Christians have been persecuted under—I mean of late, and how we have suffered. My dear
      husband shed his blood for the cause, and he was but one among many. Now there is a respite
      granted, but how long it will last we know not. The laws against us stand unrepealed and any
      one who wishes us ill can set them in motion for our destruction.” 
 “You do not think, Cousin——” 
 “Nay, hear me out, Domitia. You saw a young man approach me as we arrived here. He is what
      we
      term a deacon, and he came to announce that, if I saw fit, the Church would
      assemble in my house next first day of the week, that is the day after the Jewish Sabbath. It
      is customary with us to assemble together for prayer on that day, early, before dawn,
      sometimes in one house, then in another, so as to escape observation. And now, on the
      morrow—this assembly, which we term the Collect, will take place. Do thou tarry in thy
      chamber, and thou shalt be summoned when all have dispersed.” 
 “Nay, I would see and hear what takes place.” 
 “That may not be, Domitia, that is only for the initiated.” 
 “But why secrecy if there be naught of which to be ashamed?” 
 “Our Master said, Give not that which is holy unto dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before
      swine. Tell me, Domitia, how would you endure were your father made a mock of, his sayings and
      acts parodied on the stage, and turned into a matter of low buffoonery?” 
 Domitia’s brow flamed and her eyes flashed. 
 “I see your answer in your face. So with our Great Master. His mysteries are holy, and we
      would preserve them from outrage. Now you understand why you cannot be present.” 
 “But I would not mock.” 
 “It is our rule, to avoid the chance of profanity.” 
 “As you will.” 
 “There is one thing more,” said Flavia. “You will not be angry if I have sent to have poor
      Glyceria brought here. Owing to her infirmity she has not been able to be present at a
      gathering of the Church
      for a long time, and nothing could give her greater consolation and happiness.” 
 “I am willing for anything that can cheer her,” answered Domitia; then in a tone of
      vexation, “So—a freedwoman, and Euphrosyne, a slave, will be admitted where I am shut out—I,
      who was Empress——” 
 “Do not be offended. Is it not so in every sodality, that the members of the Club alone
      attend the gatherings of the Club.” 
 “You are a Club then?” 
 “We are the worshippers of God.”
     
 Domitia was silent, then Flavia started up. “I hear them—they have come with Glyceria. I
      must see that she be cared for. The long journey to that frail and broken frame will have
      exhausted her slender powers.” 
 “And I will go, too”—with a tinge of jealousy in her manner. Domitia little liked that
      another should interest herself about the poor woman, and should stand to her in a more
      intimate relation than herself. 
 On going forth, all feeling of envy disappeared at once before a sense of alarm. 
 An accident had occurred on the way. Owing to some fault in the paving of the road, one of
      the bearers had stumbled and, in falling, the litter had been thrown down and the woman within
      injured. 
 Domitia saw by the ashen face and the green hue about the mouth and temples that Glyceria
      was in great pain. But her eyes were bright and sought her at once and a world of love flowed
      out of them, she put forth her thin hand to lay hold of the great lady.
      Domitia at once flashed into anger. “This comes of bringing her here. Had she
      been left at Gabii it would never have happened. Where is the fellow who threw her
      down?—Flavia! have him whipped with the scorpion.” 
 Glyceria caught her hand. “It was an accident. He was not in fault. I am happy. It is the
      will of God—that is everything to me.” 
 “You suffer.” 
 The paralyzed woman could not speak more. She was being lifted out of the litter, and
      fainted as she was moved. She was conveyed, in a condition of unconsciousness, to the room she
      was to occupy, a room opening out of the same corridor as that given up to Domitia. 
 The family physician was summoned; he gave little hopes of the poor woman recovering from
      the shock, her natural strength and recuperative power had long ago been exhausted. 
 All that evening Domitia remained silent, apparently in ill humor, or great distress, and
      Flavia Domitilla was unable to get many words from her. 
 She retired early to rest, but could not sleep. Before going to her bed, she had visited
      the sick woman, and she convinced herself with her own eyes that the flame of the lamp of life
      was flickering to extinction. 
 Domitia loved the actor’s widow with all the passion of her stormy heart; and the thought
      of losing her was to her unendurable. 
 The night was still, balmy, and the heavens star-besprent. She looked from the corridor at
      the lights above, and then dropped the curtains over her door. She threw herself on her
      cushions, but her thoughts turned and tossed in her head. 
 She pressed her knuckles to her eyeballs to close her eyes, but could not force on sleep. 
 It was to her as though every person whom she loved was taken from her; till she had no one
      left to whom her heart could cling. 
 “I vow a pig to Æsculapius!” she said, “if he will recover her!” and then impatiently
      turned to the wall. “What can Æsculapius do? Whom has he succored at any time? He is but a
      name.” To whom could she cry? What god of Olympus would stoop to care for—even to look at an
      actor’s widow, a poor Greek freedwoman.
     
 The gods! They revelled and drank Ambrosia; made love and deceived the simple, and lied and
      showed themselves to be arrant knaves. They were greedy of sacrifices, they accepted all that
      was given—but they gave nothing in return. Their ears were open to flattery, not to prayer.
      They were gods for the merry and rich, not for the miserable and poor. 
 She thought she heard hasty steps in the passage, then voices. “And He! the God of
      Glyceria—why had not He saved her from this fall? Was He as powerless, as regardless, of His
      votaries as those of Olympus?” Yes—something was the matter—there was a stir in the house—at
      that hour—at dead of night—Domitia’s heart bounded. Was Glyceria passing away? 
 She threw a mantle about her, and barefooted as she was, ran forth into the gallery. 
 She saw at the further end a light at the door of the sick room, and sounds issued thence. 
 Instantly she flew thither, plucked aside the curtain, and stood in the doorway, arrested
      by the sight. 
 Euphrosyne was seated on the bed, and had raised
      her sister in her arms; the sick woman rested against her in a sitting posture;
      Flavia Domitilla was there as well. Directly she saw Domitia she signed to her to approach. 
 But Glyceria!—she was at once transfigured. Her face seemed to shine with a supernatural
      light—it had acquired a loveliness and transparency as of an angel—her eyes were upraised and
      fixed as in a trance, and her arms were outspread. She seemed not to weigh on Euphrosyne, but
      to be raised and sustained by supernatural power. 
 The joy, the rapture in that sublimated countenance were beyond description. She saw, she
      knew, she felt none of those things that usually meet the senses. And yet Domitia, Flavia,
      were convinced that those illumined happy eyes looked on some One—were gazing into a light to
      themselves unseen. 
 From her lips poured rapturous prayer. 
 “I see Thee! Thou—the joy of my heart, my hope and my portion forever! Thee whom I have
      loved and longed for! I hold Thee—I clasp Thy feet! O give her to me—the dear mistress! Take
      me, take me to Thyself—but ere I go—by Thy wounded hands—by Thy thorn-crowned head—by Thy
      pierced side—bring her to the light! To the light! To the light!” And suddenly—with an
      instantaneous eclipse the illumination died off from her face, the tension was over, the arms,
      the entire body sank heavily against the bosom of Euphrosyne, the eyes closed; she heaved a
      long sigh, but a smile lingered about her lips. 
 Awed, not daring to draw nearer, unwilling to go back, Domitia stood looking. Neither did
      Flavia Domitilla stir. 
 After a little while, however, the latter signed to
      Domitia to depart, and made as though she also would go. 
 “She sleeps,” she said. 
 Then Glyceria’s bright eyes opened, and she said:— 
 “Not till after the Collect—at that I must be—bear me down—then only——” 
 Before the day began to break, from various quarters came men and women, in twos and threes
      to the house of Flavia Domitilla. 
 The visitor to Rome may see the very spot where stood her house and garden. For this good
      woman converted the latter into a place of sepulture for the Christians, and the catacomb that
      bears her name is one of the most interesting of those about Rome. Not only so, but the ruins
      of her villa remain, on the farm of Tor Marancia, or the Ardeatine Way. Here lived the widow
      of the martyr Clemens, with her sister-in-law, Plautilla, and her niece, of the same name as
      herself, all three holy women, serving God and ministering to the necessities of the poor. 
 The Collect, or assembly of the Faithful, was to take place in the atrium or hall of the
      villa. Domitilla had only Christian slaves with her in her country residence, and could trust
      them. 
 In the large mansions of the Roman nobility there were grand reception halls, called
      basilicas, with rows of pillars down the sides dividing them into a nave and
      aisles, with an apse, or bema as it was termed, at the end, in
      which the master of the house sat to receive his visitors. Here he and his clients, his
      parasites and friends walked, talked, declaimed, listened to readings, when the weather was
      wet or cold. At a later period, when the nobility became Christian, many of them gave up their
      basilicas to be converted into churches, and such is the origin of several churches of Rome.
      They never were, as some have erroneously supposed, halls of justice—they were, as described,
      the halls attached to the great Roman palaces. 
 But at the time I am speaking of, no such surrenders had been made. The great families had
      not been converted, only here and there, at rare intervals, some of their members had embraced
      the Gospel. But smaller people had become Christian, and these did temporarily give up the
      more public portion of the house, the atrium and tablinum for Christian worship. It was
      dangerous to thus assemble, and it would have been infinitely more dangerous had the
      assemblies taken place always at the same house. Accordingly it was contrived to vary the
      place of meeting and to give secret notice to the faithful where the gathering would be on the
      ensuing Lord’s day. 
 The danger of these Collects was further reduced by their being held sometimes in the
      churches underground in the catacombs, or in the cellæ near the tombs; and
      these gatherings passed uncommented on, as it was customary for the pagans to meet for a
      solemn banquet in the decorated chambers attached to their places of interment on the
      anniversaries of the death of their friends. 
 The various guilds also had their meeting for the
      transaction of business, a sacred meal, and a sacrifice to the gods, and the
      early Christians were able so to copy the customs of the guilds or sodalities, as to carry on
      their worship undetected by the authorities, who supposed their assemblies were mere guild
      gatherings. 
 The hour was so early that lights were necessary, and lamps were suspended in the tablinum,
      which was raised a couple of steps above the floor of the hall. 
 Round the arc of the chamber, which was semi-circular, seats had been arranged, and in the
      centre against the wall one of more dignity than the rest, covered with white linen. In the
      midst of the tablinum at the top of the two steps was a table, and on one side a desk on legs. 
 Great care was taken at the door to admit none but such as could give the sign that they
      were Christians. The ostiarius or porter in the early Church held a very
      important office, on his discretion much of the safety of the Church depended. He had to use
      the utmost caution lest a spy should slip in. 
 The hall rapidly filled. 
 Before the steps into the apse lay Glyceria on a sort of bier, her hands folded, and her
      earnest eyes upraised! She had been gently, carefully conveyed thither, to be for the last
      time united in worship with the Church on earth, before she passed into the Church beyond. 
 On each side of the tablinum were curtains, that could be easily and rapidly drawn along a
      rod and so close the apse. 
 In the atrium itself there were few lights. They were not needed, day would soon break. 
 In the tablinum, against the wall, sat the presbyters with Clement, the bishop, in the
      centre. He was an
      old man, with a gentle face, full of love. He had been a freedman of the
      Flavians, and it was out of respect to them that he had taken the name of Clement, which was
      one of those in use in their family. 
 At his side, on the right hand, was one far more aged than he—one we have seen before, Luke
      the Physician and Evangelist. 
 Now one with a pair of clappers gave a signal and all rose who had been seated. 
 A deacon standing at the top of the step said:—“Let us pray for the Emperor.” 
 Whereupon all the congregation responded as with a single voice: “Lord, have mercy.” 
 Then Clement, the Bishop, prayed:—“We beseech Thee, O Father, to look down upon the Emperor
      and to strengthen him against his foes, and to illumine his mind that he may rule in Justice,
      and be Thou his defence and strong tower.” 
 Thereupon the deacon called again:—“Let us pray for the magistrates.” To which the people
      responded in the same manner, and the Bishop prayed in few terse words for the magistrates. In
      precisely similar manner was prayer made for the bishops and clergy, for all the faithful, for
      those in chains, working in mines, for the sick and the sorrowful, for the widows and orphans;
      it was as though a flood of all-embracing charity flowed forth. 
 Then the intercessions ended, Luke came to the desk, and a deacon brought the roll of the
      Law and unfolded it before him, and another held aloft a torch. 
 He read as follows:—“This commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from
      thee neither is it far off.... But the word is very nigh
      thee in thy heart and in thy mouth, that thou mayest do it. See, I have set
      before thee life and good, and death and evil.... I call heaven and earth to record this day
      that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life ...
      that thou mayest love the Lord thy God, and that thou mayest obey His voice, and that thou
      mayest cleave unto Him.” 
 Then the Evangelist closed the roll and returned it to the deacon, and he spake some words
      of exhortation thereon. 
 Next came another deacon and unfolded the roll of the Prophets; and Luke read:—“The Spirit
      of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the
      meek; He hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and
      the opening of the prison to them that are bound. To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord,
      and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.... To give to them that mourn
      beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of
      heaviness; that they might be called Trees of Righteousness, the Planting of the Lord, that He
      might be glorified.” 
 Then again Luke spoke a few simple words and declared how that the prophecy of old was
      fulfilled in Christ who was the healer of all sick souls, and the strengthener of all who were
      feeble, the restorer of the halt, the comforter of all that mourn, and the planter in the
      field of the Church of such as would grow up plants of righteousness to bear their fruit in
      due season. 
 And when he ceased, the congregation sang a psalm: “Praise the Lord, O my soul: and all
      that is within me praise His holy name.” 
 In the first age of the Church the liturgical service grew out of that of the synagogue. As
      in the latter there were the two lessons from Law and Prophet, so was there in the Church, but
      after the Psalm there were added to these, two more lessons, one from an Epistle by an Apostle
      and one from a Gospel. 
 At the time of our narrative the service was in process of formation and was not yet
      formed; and the sequence of Epistle and Gospel had not as yet been established. However, now
      Luke stood forward and said:— 
 “Beloved, we have a letter written by the Blessed John—the Disciple that Jesus loved, and
      therefrom I will read a few words.” 
 Then he unfolded a short roll and read as follows:— 
 “Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the
      sons of God! therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew Him not. Beloved, now are we
      the sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that, when He shall
      appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. And every man that hath this hope
      in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.” 
 He ceased, for a strange sound reached the ears of all—a sound that swelled and rose and
      then fell away and became all but inaudible. 
 Once again he began to read—and again this sound was heard. 
 “This is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.” 
 Again he ceased, and looked round, and listened. For once more this strange wailing sound
      arose. 
 But as it declined, he resumed his reading. 
 “Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. We know that we have passed from death
      unto life, because we love the brethren.” 
 He was constrained to cease. 
 Then at a signal, two deacons went in the direction of the sound. And the whole
      congregation was hushed. But Glyceria, on her bed, lifted her hands and her eyes shone with
      expectation. 
 Presently the deacons returned:—“A woman—a weeping woman in a dark room.” 
 Then Luke descended from the bema, and attended by them went in the
      direction of the voice, and came, where crouching, concealed, Domitia lay on the ground,
      sobbing as if her heart would break—they could not stay her—they did not try—they waited. 
 And presently she raised her face, streaming with tears, and said—“The light! the glorious
      light!” 
 And the sun rose over the roof, and shone down into the atrium, on the face of Glyceria. 
 Then Flavia Domitilla stooped over her, laid her hand on her eyes and said:—“In the Joy of
      thy Lord, Face to Face!”
