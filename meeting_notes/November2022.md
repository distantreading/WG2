# Notes from November meeting

## News about the Action

### Extension
The Action has been extended and granted additional budget for this last period, so we can proceed with our activities and hopefully meet in person in the final conference or TS and STSMs before. We are also moving forward with planning the final Training School in Belgrade (22-24 March, hybrid event, call to be announced soon) and conference (21-22 April in Krak√≥w, call for paper is out and can be found in Christof's email, and we encourage you to participate).

### STSMs and VMGs
It is possible to participate in both STSMs and their virtual counterparts VMGs until the end of March

### Withdrawal of MC subsitute role
As of December 2021, COST has withdrew the function of substitute members. This change of status does not influence current members, as explained in Christof's email you should have all received:
"please be assured that current substitute members can of course retain an active role in the Action. For example, you should all have been assigned, if it wasn't the case already, the role of WG group member. You continue to be eligible for reimbursement of travel and accommodation for any event, such as a WG meeting or a Training School, organized by the Action. Also, you can still be nominated to serve on the MC, for a period of up to 6 months, if one of the regular MC members agrees to nominte you for this role. If that is the case, you are of course also eligible for reimbursement of travel and accommodation for MC meetings."
  
Please note, that COST now requires all WG members, old and new, to register officially, through the e-COST system, to become members of the WGs they are involved in or would like to participate in. Luckily, it is easy. Just follow the link and feel free to fill in the form using just a few quick words: https://e-services.cost.eu/action/CA16204/working-groups/apply

Please fill this in as soon as possible, the general politics is that everyone who's already been a member before this rule was introduced will be accepted, but we need to have this formality done.

## Level 2 discussions

### Update on the state of discussions pre-meeting
In September we had a small meeting for those of you who have been active in email discussions on Level 2 in the last months, which was aimed to bring the points of these discussions closer. You can find detailed notes of findings from both the email exchanges that happened over WG2 list and their sum-up in that meeting here: https://github.com/distantreading/WG2/blob/master/other_notes/level2-status-2021.md
This stage has been accepted.

### Measure of quality of annotations
Next to the well-known Level 2 problems we discussed already before, a new suggestion was proposed by Michael: should we provide a measure of quality of the various annotations?  
When this came up in the small meeting we thought the idea of providing information about the quality of annotation of particular texts is worth considering. But implementing this requires some discussions - do we define a uniform manner of evaluating the quality? at what stage should it be measured (pre or post possible manual corrections)? where and how should it be encoded? 
In the November meeting we agreed it was a very difficult task to achieve reliably across language collections. We agreed that the basic thing we could do would be provide information what tools and why were used in the annotation, embedding this information in the headers. We could also consider adding information about number of tokens, persons, nouns, etc. if they are available, but treating is as a secondary goal to completing level 2.

## Action affiliated initiatives

### CLS Infra
A new project will continue some aspects of our COST Action,[Computational Literary Studies Infrastructure (CLS INFRA)] (https://clsinfra.io/). The initiative will be conducting workshops as well as research aimed at identifying and filling the gaps in CLS education and studies in Europe. 
### JoCLS
I would also like to draw your attention to the new journal that is partly an outcome of our Action's and CLS Infra's initative: Journal of Computational Literary Studies. The call for papers is open until 15th December: https://jcls.io/site/cfp/ and is related to the conference associated with the first issue of JCLS that will take place on June 1-3, 2022 at Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany. You are more than welcome to submit your proposals.
### Papers
Some ideas for papers using ELTeC data are shaping up, Fotis described to us an idea of examining differences character inner life in modernist and other novels across corpora.
